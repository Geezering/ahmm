### Franz Kline
- Franz Kline was a leading figure in Abstract Expressionism, best known for his bold, large-scale black and white paintings that resemble energetic brushstrokes or calligraphy
- His work is often seen as a form of 'action painting', where the act of painting itself becomes as important as the finished image, aiming to create a physical engagement with the viewer

- Motherwell was also an influential writer and thinker, helping to explain and promote the ideas behind abstract art to a wider audience
### Clyfford Still
- Clyfford Still was one of the first artists to develop a completely abstract style, using jagged fields of colour to create dramatic, monumental paintings
- He believed that art should be a deeply personal and spiritual experience, and he often refused to explain his work, leaving it open to interpretation
- Still’s influence on Abstract Expressionism was profound, and he is seen as a pioneer of colour field painting
### Adolph Gottlieb
- Adolph Gottlieb was an American abstract painter who helped shape the Abstract Expressionist movement with his use of symbols and bold, simplified forms
- His "Burst" series features powerful contrasts of circles and lines, exploring universal themes of chaos and order
- Gottlieb was also a strong advocate for artists' rights and played a key role in organising the first generation of Abstract Expressionists
### Arshile Gorky
- Arshile Gorky played a central role in moving American art towards abstraction, blending influences from Cubism and Surrealism with his own personal history
- His paintings often reflect themes of memory, trauma, and loss, especially influenced by his experiences during the Armenian Genocide
- Gorky’s organic forms and expressive brushwork paved the way for Abstract Expressionism in the late 1940s
### David Smith

- He brought the energy and spontaneity of Abstract Expressionist painting into three dimensions, creating dynamic works that interact with their environment
- Smith’s innovative approach influenced generations of sculptors and expanded the possibilities of modern sculpture
### Ad Reinhardt
- Ad Reinhardt is famous for his "black paintings," which appear almost entirely black but reveal subtle variations upon close inspection
- He was a champion of pure abstraction, believing that art should be free from narrative and personal expression
- Reinhardt’s minimalist approach and strict ideas about art’s purpose were highly influential on later minimalist and conceptual artists
### Agnes Martin
- Agnes Martin is celebrated for her serene, grid-based paintings that use soft colours and delicate lines to evoke a sense of calm and contemplation
- She saw her work as expressions of inner peace and spiritual harmony, rather than representations of the physical world
- Martin’s subtle, meditative style has made her a key figure in both Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism
### Cy Twombly
- Cy Twombly is known for his large, scribbled, and calligraphic paintings that combine drawing and writing in expressive, poetic ways
- His work often references classical literature and mythology, blending abstract marks with hints of narrative
- Twombly’s unique style bridges the gap between abstraction and language, inviting viewers to find their own meanings
### Sam Francis
- Sam Francis was an American painter known for his vibrant, colourful abstract works that often feature splashes and drips of paint
- He was influenced by both American Abstract Expressionism and European modernism, creating art that feels spontaneous and energetic
- Francis’s use of colour and light gives his paintings a sense of openness and optimism
### Jules Olitski
- Jules Olitski was a leading figure in Colour Field painting, known for his technique of spraying paint onto canvas to create luminous, atmospheric effects
- His work focuses on the sensory experience of colour, often avoiding any sense of depth or traditional composition
- Olitski’s innovative methods helped redefine what painting could be in the post-war era
### Philip Guston
- Philip Guston began as an Abstract Expressionist but later shocked the art world by returning to figurative painting, using cartoon-like imagery to explore personal and political themes
- His later works feature bold, simple shapes and a limited palette, often depicting everyday objects and hooded figures as symbols of anxiety and injustice
- Guston’s shift from abstraction to figuration has inspired many artists to follow their own creative instincts, regardless of trends
### In Simple Terms for Students:
- **Abstract Expressionism** was about expressing strong feelings with new, bold ways of painting
- **Artists wanted to show what was inside their minds and hearts**, not just what things looked like
- **The movement made New York the centre of the art world** and changed how people thought about art forever[1][7]
