# Neo Geo
## Geometric Abstraction as Social Critique
- Neo Geo (short for Neo-Geometric Conceptualism) artists used sharp, geometric shapes and abstract forms to comment on modern society
- Their art critiqued consumerism (obsession with buying things), commercialisation (turning everything into something to sell), and the way technology and modern life shape how we experience the world
- The geometry in their work often stands for the rigid, artificial structures of city life and the feeling of isolation in a technological age
## Irony, Simulation, and Mass Production
- Neo Geo artists played with the idea of “simulation”-making art that looks like something mass-produced or artificial, rather than unique or handmade
- They often borrowed images and styles from advertising, branding, and industrial design, blurring the line between art and consumer products
- Their work sometimes mocks or questions whether art can truly criticise consumer society when it is also bought and sold for high prices
## Ambiguity and Self-Reflection
- The movement is known for being self-aware and sometimes contradictory
- While it critiques the superficiality and emptiness of consumer culture, Neo Geo art itself became highly marketable and popular, raising questions about whether it is truly critical or just part of the system it comments on
- Artists like Peter Halley and Jeff Koons used bright colours, industrial materials, and familiar objects to make viewers think about the meaning and value of art in a world full of copies and simulations
