# Artists And Period:  
### Pablo Picasso
- Picasso was a co-founder of Cubism, pioneering the movement alongside Georges Braque and radically changing the way artists represented reality
- He explored multiple viewpoints in a single image, breaking objects into geometric forms and reassembling them in abstracted compositions
- Picasso’s work in both Analytic and Synthetic Cubism introduced collage, text, and new materials into fine art
### Georges Braque
- Braque worked closely with Picasso to develop Cubism, especially the Analytic phase, emphasising muted colours and the fragmentation of form
- He was interested in the relationship between objects and space, often painting still lifes that challenge traditional perspective
- Braque’s use of texture, stencilled letters, and trompe-l'œil effects played a key role in the evolution of Cubist techniques
### Juan Gris
- Gris brought a more structured and precise approach to Cubism, using clear lines and bright, harmonious colours
- He is known for his Synthetic Cubist works, which often feature collage elements and a careful balance of composition
- Gris’s art helped to clarify and popularise Cubist ideas, making them more accessible and decorative
### Fernand Léger
- Léger’s version of Cubism was more mechanical and dynamic, often incorporating cylindrical forms and bold contrasts
- He was fascinated by modern life and technology, reflecting these themes in his Cubist paintings of machines, cities, and workers
- Léger’s style, sometimes called “Tubism,” influenced later movements such as Purism and modern graphic design
### Robert Delaunay
- Delaunay developed a colourful, abstract form of Cubism known as Orphism, focusing on the interplay of light and colour
- He explored the fragmentation of form but placed greater emphasis on rhythm and movement within his compositions
- Delaunay’s vibrant works, especially his series on the Eiffel Tower, helped expand Cubism into pure abstraction
### Albert Gleizes
- Gleizes was both a painter and a theorist, helping to define and spread Cubist ideas through his writing and teaching
- His works often feature large, interlocking planes and a strong sense of rhythm and movement
- Gleizes believed Cubism should reflect the modern world and collective experience, rather than individual perception
### Jean Metzinger
- Metzinger was instrumental in developing the theoretical foundations of Cubism, co-authoring the influential book “Du Cubisme” with Gleizes
- His paintings combine multiple perspectives and fractured forms with a refined, decorative sense of colour and pattern
- Metzinger’s approach helped bridge the gap between early Cubist experimentation and its broader acceptance in the art world
### Marcel Duchamp
- Duchamp’s Cubist works, such as “Nude Descending a Staircase, No
- 2,” introduced movement and time as key elements in the style
- He pushed the boundaries of Cubism by blending it with Futurist ideas and questioning the very nature of art
- Duchamp’s innovations paved the way for Dada, conceptual art, and other avant-garde movements

## Key Themes, Ideas, And Artistic Aspects
### Pablo Picasso
- Broke Down Objects And People Into Geometric Shapes And Overlapping Planes, Showing Them From Several Viewpoints At Once[1][2][3]
- Used A Limited Colour Palette (Mainly Browns, Greys, And Ochres) To Focus Attention On Form And Structure, Not On Bright Colours[2][5]
- Challenged Traditional Art By Making Viewers Work To “Read” The Painting, Turning Looking At Art Into An Active Process[1][3]
### Georges Braque
- Worked Closely With Picasso, Developing The Style Together So Their Paintings From This Period Look Very Similar[4][5]
- Focused On Still Life Subjects (Like Musical Instruments And Bottles), Dissecting Them Into Fragments And Reassembling Them In Complex, Dense Compositions[4][1]
- Emphasised The Flatness Of The Canvas, Using Overlapping Planes And Subtle Colours To Blur The Line Between Background And Foreground[2][3]
### Juan Gris
- Brought A More Structured, Precise Approach To Analytic Cubism, Often Making The Fragmented Forms Clearer And More Organised[6][7]
- Used Slightly Brighter Colours And Clearer Shapes Than Picasso And Braque, Making His Cubist Works Easier To “Read.”
- Helped Bridge The Gap Between Analytic And Later Synthetic Cubism, Influencing The Movement’s Next Phase[6][7]
## In Simple Terms For Students
### Analytic Cubism:
- Was About Breaking Down Objects Into Parts And Showing Them From Many Angles At Once, Like Looking At Something Through A Shattered Mirror[2][3]
- Artists Used Dull Colours So The Viewer Would Focus On Shapes, Lines, And Structure, Not On Colour[2][3][5]
- Paintings Often Look Busy And Complicated In The Centre, Making You Look Closely And Think About What You’re Seeing[2][3]
This Movement Made People Question How We See And Represent The World, Setting The Stage For Modern Art
