## Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects
### Marcel Duchamp
- Introduced the idea of the “readymade”-ordinary objects (like a urinal or bicycle wheel) displayed as art to question what art really is[1][2]
- Used irony and humour to challenge traditional art values and the seriousness of museums and galleries
- His work encouraged artists to focus on ideas and concepts, not just skill or beauty
### Hannah Höch
- Pioneered photomontage, cutting and rearranging photographs from magazines and newspapers to create new, often satirical images[2][3]
- Critiqued gender roles and politics, especially the position of women in society, through her art
- Used randomness and chance, showing that art could be playful, critical, and made from everyday materials
### Tristan Tzara
- Wrote important Dada manifestos, using nonsense and absurdity to attack logic and traditional thinking[2][3]
- Organised performances and poetry readings that involved chaos, sound poetry (nonsense words and noises), and audience participation
- Believed that art should provoke, confuse, and make people question everything, not just please the eye
## In Simple Terms for Students
- **Dada artists:**
- Were rebels who wanted to shock society and show that art could be anything, even a joke or a random object
- They used nonsense, humour, and everyday materials to protest against war and the rules of “serious” art
- Their work was about breaking boundaries, making people think, and showing that art could be found anywhere
