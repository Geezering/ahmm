New Expressionism and New Image Painting
## Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects
Raw Emotion, Bold Colour, and Vigorous Brushwork
New Expressionism (also called Neo-Expressionism) is known for its intense emotional energy, using bold, sometimes jarring colours and thick, expressive brushstrokes
- Artists like Georg Baselitz, Anselm Kiefer, and Julian Schnabel painted in a way that felt spontaneous and powerful, often on a large scale
- Their works show strong feelings and personal visions, sometimes appearing rough or even violent in their execution
- Return to the Figure and Storytelling
Unlike the abstract or minimalist art that came before, these artists brought back recognisable images, especially the human figure, but often in a distorted, exaggerated, or cartoon-like way
- Many works tell stories or refer to history, myth, politics, or personal experience
- For example, Anselm Kiefer’s paintings often deal with German history, while Jean-Michel Basquiat used graffiti-like figures to explore identity and society
- Mixing Materials and Breaking Boundaries
New Image Painting and Neo-Expressionism often combined different materials and techniques, such as sand, fabric, found objects, or collage, alongside paint
- This mixed-media approach made the artworks more textured and physical
- The movement also blurred the line between painting and sculpture, and between “high” art and popular culture, drawing on influences from punk, pop art, and street art
