Rococo period
## Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects

- This style was meant to be visually exciting and surprising, making rooms and artworks feel lively and full of movement
### Celebration of Aristocratic Life and Fantasy

- Paintings and decorative arts showed scenes of parties, flirting, music, and mythological stories, often with hidden hints at romance or sensuality
