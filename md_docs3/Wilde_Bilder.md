# Wilde Bilder
## Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects
### Expressive, Wild Painting Style
- The Wilde Bilder (literally “Wild Pictures”) movement is known for its bold, expressive use of colour and brushwork
- Artists painted with intense energy, often using thick paint and dramatic gestures
- This style was a reaction against the calm, controlled art that came before, aiming to show raw emotion and personal experience on the canvas
### Figurative Focus and Urban Life
- Instead of abstract shapes, Wilde Bilder artists focused on recognisable figures-often people, city scenes, or nightlife
- Their work captured the chaos, excitement, and sometimes alienation (feeling alone in a crowd) of urban life, especially in Berlin during the 1980s
### Rebellion and Individual Identity
- The movement was rebellious, breaking away from art rules and traditions
- Many artists explored themes of gender, identity, and the role of the outsider
- For example, Elvira Bach’s paintings often show powerful women, reflecting both personal and feminist ideas about what it means to be a woman artist in a male-dominated world
