# Impressionism (1870–1880): Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects
## Three Short Points
### Capturing Light, Colour, and the Moment
- Impressionist artists like Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir focused on painting the effects of light and colour as they appeared at a specific moment in time
- They used visible, quick brushstrokes and often painted outdoors (en plein air) to show how sunlight, shadows, and reflections changed throughout the day
- Their aim was not to create a perfect, detailed image, but to give an impression of what they saw and felt in that instant
### Everyday Life and Modern Subjects
- **Instead of painting grand historical or mythological scenes, Impressionists chose ordinary, modern subjects:** city streets, train stations, gardens, dancers, and people at leisure
- Artists like Edgar Degas and Mary Cassatt showed scenes of daily life, often with unusual viewpoints, as if glimpsed by chance
- This made their art feel fresh, spontaneous, and connected to the world around them
### Innovative Techniques and Rejection of Tradition
- Impressionists broke the rules of traditional art by using loose, broken brushwork, pure unmixed colours, and open compositions where the subject sometimes blends into the background
- They abandoned the careful, smooth finish of academic painting, making their works look sketchy or unfinished to critics at the time
- Advances in paint technology (like paint in tubes) and new ideas about colour helped them work more freely and quickly outdoors

## ## Artists and Period
- **Period:** 1870–1880
## Key Artists:
### Claude Monet
- Monet was the founder and most influential figure of Impressionism, pioneering the movement’s focus on capturing fleeting effects of light, atmosphere, and colour through loose brushwork and plein-air painting
- He consistently depicted landscapes, gardens, and scenes of modern life, striving to represent his direct perception of nature rather than idealised or historical subjects
- Monet’s innovative approach, including his famous series paintings such as "Water Lilies" and "Haystacks," led to a new understanding of visual experience and laid the groundwork for modernist abstraction
### Alfred Sisley
- Sisley was a central Impressionist landscape painter, known for his delicate treatment of light and atmospheric effects, particularly in river and rural scenes
- His palette was typically cool and restrained, favouring subtle harmonies over the brighter colours of some contemporaries
- Sisley’s commitment to painting outdoors and his focus on naturalistic observation made him a consistent and poetic voice within Impressionism
### Edgar Degas
- Degas brought a unique perspective to Impressionism, focusing on scenes of urban life, ballet dancers, and women at work, often rendered with innovative compositions and viewpoints
- He excelled in drawing and pastel, capturing fleeting gestures and movement with precision and psychological insight
- Degas’s interest in artificial light, modern interiors, and the dynamics of the human body set his work apart from the plein-air landscapes of his peers
### Camille Pissarro
- Pissarro was a key organiser and mentor within the Impressionist group, known for his depictions of rural labour, village life, and changing seasons
- His brushwork and palette evolved over time, but he remained committed to painting directly from nature and exploring the effects of light
- Pissarro’s democratic spirit and collaborative ethos helped sustain the Impressionist exhibitions and fostered innovation among his colleagues
### Pierre-Auguste Renoir
- Renoir’s Impressionist paintings are celebrated for their luminous colour, sensual brushwork, and joyful depictions of social gatherings, leisure, and the human figure
- He excelled at capturing the effects of sunlight on skin and fabric, creating vibrant, lively scenes filled with warmth and intimacy
- Renoir’s later work moved towards a more classical style, but his early contributions were central to the development of Impressionist technique and subject matter
### Berthe Morisot
- Morisot was a pioneering female Impressionist, known for her sensitive portrayals of domestic life, women, and children, often painted with rapid, expressive brushstrokes
- She brought a fresh, intimate perspective to Impressionism, focusing on private moments and the subtle interplay of light and atmosphere
- Morisot’s work challenged gender norms in the art world and expanded the range of Impressionist subjects
### Mary Cassatt
- Cassatt, an American in Paris, specialised in scenes of mothers and children, capturing intimate relationships with a keen eye for gesture and emotion
- Her use of pastel and innovative compositions reflected both Impressionist influences and her own distinct vision
- Cassatt was instrumental in introducing Impressionism to American audiences and advocated for women’s participation in the arts
### Gustave Caillebotte
- Caillebotte’s paintings often depict modern urban life, with a focus on Parisian streets, interiors, and the effects of rain and light on city surfaces
- He combined Impressionist colour and brushwork with a more structured, almost photographic realism, contributing
