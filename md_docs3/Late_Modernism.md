# Late Modernism (1960–1970): Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects
## Three Short Points
### Emphasis on Abstraction, Colour, and Form
- Late Modernist artists like Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Ellsworth Kelly, and Frank Stella focused on abstraction, using large areas of pure colour, simple geometric shapes, and clear, flat surfaces
- Their work often removed any reference to real-world objects, concentrating instead on how colours and shapes interact on the canvas
- This style is sometimes called Post-Painterly Abstraction, which means painting that is precise, clean, and not about the artist’s emotions or dramatic brushwork
### Reduction of Personal Expression
- Unlike earlier movements such as Abstract Expressionism, which were about showing the artist’s feelings, Late Modernist painters aimed to remove personal emotion from their art
- They used repeated patterns, hard edges, and even industrial processes to make their work look impersonal and objective
- The focus was on the artwork as an object, not as a story or message, and on the viewer’s direct, visual experience
### Exploration of Materials and Space
- These artists experimented with new materials (like acrylic paints) and techniques, creating works that often look machine-made
- They were interested in how paintings relate to the space around them, sometimes making shaped canvases or large-scale works that change how you move through a gallery
- Their art was about clarity, order, and the idea that “what you see is what you see”
# Contextual information
## Main location(s):
United States (especially New York), with influence in Western Europe
## Relevant previous art movements:
- Abstract Expressionism (emotional, gestural painting)
- Minimalism (simplicity, geometric forms)
- Colour Field Painting (large areas of colour)
## Relevant culture and politics:
- **1960s:** A period of social change, protest, and questioning of tradition (civil rights, student movements, counterculture)
- The rise of consumer culture and new technologies
# Relevant writers and Composers:
### Writers: 
- Clement Greenberg (art critic who supported abstraction)
- Donald Judd (artist and writer)
## Composers:
- Steve Reich
- Philip Glass (minimalist music with repetition and simplicity)
# Contemporary inventions and technology:
- Acrylic paints and new synthetic materials
- Mass production and industrial fabrication
- Television and new media
## Typical fashions of the day for men and women:
- **Men:** Slim-cut suits, turtlenecks, and simple shirts; casual styles became more popular
- **Women:**  Shift dresses, geometric patterns, bold colours, and minimalist accessories
- **Both:** Fashion reflected simplicity, clean lines, and a move away from elaborate decoration
## Artists and Period: 1960–1970
## Key Artists:
### Morris Louis
- Morris Louis was a leading figure in Colour Field painting and the Washington Color School, known for his innovative use of the soak-stain technique, where thinned acrylic paint was poured onto unprimed canvas to create luminous, flowing veils of colour
- His works are characterised by their emphasis on pure colour, flatness, and the absence of gestural brushwork, focusing instead on the optical and emotional effects of colour itself
- Louis’s approach helped redefine the possibilities of abstract painting in the post-war era, influencing generations of artists interested in process and materiality
### Kenneth Noland
- Kenneth Noland was a central figure in Colour Field painting and the Washington Color School, renowned for his use of simple geometric forms such as circles (targets), chevrons, and stripes, often painted in vibrant, contrasting colours
- He adopted the soak-stain technique, allowing thinned paint to seep into unprimed canvas, which resulted in luminous, flat fields of colour that emphasised the relationship between the image and the edge of the canvas
- Noland’s work explored the structural and emotional possibilities of colour, and his shaped canvases and bold compositions played a significant role in the development of postwar American abstraction
### Jules Olitski
- Jules Olitski was a key Colour Field painter, celebrated for his atmospheric, spray-painted canvases that created subtle gradations and fields of colour without visible brushstrokes
- He experimented with different techniques, including using spray guns to apply paint, achieving a sense of depth and luminosity through layers of colour
- Olitski’s work is noted for its focus on the sensory and spatial effects of colour, contributing to the evolution of abstract painting in the 1960s and 1970s
### Ellsworth Kelly
- Ellsworth Kelly was known for his hard-edged, minimalist paintings that featured bold, unmodulated colours and simple geometric shapes, often presented on shaped canvases
- His art emphasised form, colour, and spatial relationships, rejecting illusionism and focusing on the direct visual impact of pure colour and shape
- Kelly’s approach influenced both Colour Field painting and Minimalism, and his work remains celebrated for its clarity, precision, and visual power
### Frank Stella
- Frank Stella emerged as a leading figure in postwar abstraction, pioneering shaped canvases and geometric compositions that rejected expressive brushwork in favour of flat, hard-edged patterns
- His early "Black Paintings" and later, vividly coloured works, emphasised repetition, symmetry, and the materiality of the canvas itself
- Stella’s mantra, “What you see is what you see,” encapsulates his commitment to non-representational, self-referential art, making him a key influence on both Minimalism and Colour Field painting
# Glossary for Students
- **Abstraction:** Art that does not try to show real objects but uses shapes, colours, and lines
- **Post-Painterly Abstraction:** A style of painting that is clean, flat, and not about emotion
- **Minimalism:** Art that uses very simple shapes and materials, with no decoration
- **Hard edge:** A sharp, clear line between areas of colour or shape.
