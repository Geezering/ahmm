# Constructivism: Key Facts and Context
## Main location(s):  
- Russia (1915–1922), later the Soviet Union[1][2]
## Relevant previous art movements: 
- Russian Futurism (focus on movement and modernity)
- Suprematism (abstract art using basic geometric forms)
- Cubism (breaking down objects into geometric shapes)[1][7]
## Relevant culture and politics: 
- Emerged after the Russian Revolution (1917), closely tied to the rise of Soviet socialism and the idea of building a new, collective society
- Artists aimed to create art for social and political purposes, rejecting “art for art’s sake” in favour of practical, useful art that would help shape the new world[1][7][9]
- The movement was deeply connected to Communist ideals and the industrialisation of society
# Relevant writers and Composers:
## Writers: Vladimir Mayakovsky (poet and propagandist for the revolution), Aleksei Gan (theorist who wrote about Constructivism)[7]
## Composers:
 Arseny Avraamov and other early Soviet experimental composers who used industrial and mechanical sounds
## Contemporary Inventions and Technology: 
- Industrial materials (steel, glass, wood, plastic) and mass production techniques[2][3]
- Use of photography, photomontage (cutting and combining photos), and graphic design in posters and propaganda[9]
- Advances in architecture and engineering, such as Tatlin’s Tower (a never-built design using modern materials and technology)[9]
# Typical Fashions of the Day: 
- **Men:** Simple, functional clothing-often workers’ uniforms, tunics, and boots
- **Women:**  Practical, androgynous styles-loose dresses, work shirts, and headscarves, reflecting the movement’s focus on utility and equality
# Artists and Period:  
- 1917–1925 (main period, though influence continued later)[1]
- El Lissitzky, Alexander Rodchenko, Lyubov Popova, Naum Gabo, Varvara Stepanova, Vladimir Tatlin, the Stenberg brothers, Karl Ioganson
## Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects
### El Lissitzky
- Used bold geometric shapes, strong colours (especially red and black), and innovative layouts in posters and book designs to communicate revolutionary ideas[2][9]
- Believed art should serve society, not just be decorative, and his work often had a clear political message
- Experimented with photomontage and architecture, influencing modern graphic design and exhibition spaces
### Alexander Rodchenko
- Explored photography, painting, sculpture, and graphic design, always using simple, industrial materials and geometric forms[1][2]
- Believed art should be practical and useful, designing posters, advertisements, and everyday objects for the new Soviet society
- Used sharp angles, strong lines, and dynamic compositions to create a sense of movement and modernity
### Lyubov Popova
- Combined painting, theatre design, and textiles, using abstract, geometric patterns and bold colours[1][7]
- Focused on “construction” in art, meaning building up images from basic shapes and materials
- Worked to make art accessible and useful, designing fabrics and stage sets for the masses
### Naum Gabo
- Created abstract sculptures using transparent materials like glass and plastic to show space and movement[1][3]
- Emphasised “real space” and “real materials,” making art that looked modern and dynamic
- Co-wrote the “Realistic Manifesto,” which set out Constructivist ideas about using art to shape the future
### Varvara Stepanova
- Designed textiles and clothing with bold, geometric patterns, aiming to create practical, mass-produced fashion for workers[2]
- Believed art should be integrated into everyday life, not separate from it
- Worked closely with Rodchenko to bring Constructivist ideas into design and theatre
### Vladimir Tatlin
- Founder of Constructivism, famous for designing “Tatlin’s Tower,” a huge, futuristic monument that symbolised the new Soviet society[1][7][9]
- Used industrial materials and engineering principles, aiming to merge art and technology
- Believed art should be “constructed” like machines, focusing on function and collective purpose
### The Stenberg Brothers
- Created striking theatre posters and set designs using photomontage, bold colours, and dynamic layouts[9]
- Their work was energetic and modern, helping to define the visual style of Soviet cinema and theatre
- Used repetition, symmetry, and clear, simple fonts to communicate quickly and powerfully
### Karl Ioganson
- Built abstract, machine-like sculptures from industrial materials, exploring how art could be part of modern technology[7]
- Focused on the structure and construction of his works, rather than decoration
- Helped develop the idea that art should be functional and serve society’s needs
## In Simple Terms for Students
- **Constructivism:**
- Was about using art to help build a new, modern society, especially after the Russian Revolution
- Artists used simple geometric shapes, industrial materials, and practical designs to make art useful for everyone-not just for decoration, but for posters, buildings, clothes, and everyday objects[1][2][7]
- Their work was bold, abstract, and often aimed at spreading political ideas or improving daily life
