### Theo van Doesburg
- Believed in a universal visual language using straight lines, rectangles, and primary colours (red, blue, yellow) plus black, white, and grey[1][2]
- Promoted the idea that art, architecture, and design should all follow the same principles to create harmony in society[1][2]
- Founded and edited the De Stijl journal, spreading the movement’s ideas and encouraging collaboration between artists and architects[3][5]
### Piet Mondrian
- Created paintings using only vertical and horizontal black lines and blocks of primary colours, aiming for perfect balance and order[1][2][6]
- Called his approach "Neo-Plasticism," meaning a new way of shaping art that avoided any reference to the real world[3][5]
- Believed art could express universal truths and bring spiritual harmony to people[1][6]
### Gerrit Rietveld
- Designed furniture and buildings using De Stijl principles, most famously the Red and Blue Chair and the Rietveld Schröder House[6]
- Used simple geometric forms and primary colours to make functional objects that were also works of art[6]
- Showed how De Stijl ideas could be applied to everyday life, not just painting[4][6]
