Pre-Raphaelites
## Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects
### Naturalism and Vivid Detail
- Pre-Raphaelite artists aimed for extreme realism and accuracy in their work, carefully studying nature and using bright, intense colours
- Their paintings often look almost photographic because of the sharp focus and attention to tiny details, such as individual leaves or strands of hair
### Medievalism, Symbolism, and Storytelling
- They were inspired by medieval art and literature, filling their works with stories from myths, legends, and poetry
- Symbolism (using objects, colours, or settings to represent deeper meanings) is common-flowers, for example, might stand for love, pain, or death
### Rebellion Against Academic Art and Industrialisation
- The Pre-Raphaelites rejected the established art styles taught by the Royal Academy, especially the idealised forms of the Renaissance master Raphael
- They wanted art to be sincere and heartfelt, reflecting real experiences and emotions, and often reacted against the effects of industrialisation by showing a purer, more beautiful world

Key Artists:
### William Holman Hunt
- Hunt was a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, renowned for his meticulous attention to detail, vivid colour, and elaborate symbolism
- Influenced by John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle, he believed art should reveal the correspondence between visual signs and moral or spiritual truths, often using religious and literary themes
- Hunt remained the most faithful to Pre-Raphaelite ideals throughout his career, producing iconic works such as *The Light of the World* and *The Hireling Shepherd*, and his travels to the Holy Land brought authenticity to his biblical scenes
- His legacy includes not only his paintings but also his writings, notably his memoir *Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood* (1905), which documents the movement’s aims and history
### John Everett Millais
- Millais was a co-founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, celebrated for his technical brilliance, luminous colour, and ability to capture both natural detail and psychological depth
- His early works, such as *Ophelia* and *Christ in the House of His Parents*, exemplify the Brotherhood’s ideals of truth to nature and literary inspiration
- Millais later transitioned to a successful career as a portraitist and society painter, becoming President of the Royal Academy, but his Pre-Raphaelite period remains his most influential
### Dante Gabriel Rossetti
- Rossetti was a founding member and the poetic heart of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, known for his sensual, dreamlike paintings and evocative poetry
- His art often featured medieval, mythological, and literary subjects, rendered with rich colour, symbolic detail, and a focus on female beauty and mysticism
- Rossetti’s circle included many key artists and writers, and his work helped shape the Aesthetic Movement and Symbolism
### Ford Madox Brown
- Brown was closely associated with the Pre-Raphaelites, though not a formal member, and shared their commitment to truth to nature, vivid colour, and historical accuracy
- His major works, such as *Work* and the Manchester Murals, combined social commentary with meticulous detail and narrative complexity
- Brown’s teaching and collaborations influenced the development of Pre-Raphaelite and Arts and Crafts artists
### Edward Burne-Jones
- Burne-Jones was a leading figure in the later Pre-Raphaelite and Aesthetic movements, known for his ethereal, decorative paintings and designs
- His works often depicted mythological or Arthurian subjects, characterised by elongated figures, jewel-like colour, and a sense of poetic melancholy
- Burne-Jones collaborated closely with William Morris on stained glass, textiles, and book illustration, helping to shape the Arts and Crafts Movement
### William Morris
- Morris was a designer, writer, and social reformer, central to the Arts and Crafts Movement and a close associate of the Pre-Raphaelites
- He advocated for the integration of art and life, reviving traditional craftsmanship and opposing industrial mass production
- Morris’s designs for wallpaper, textiles, and books, as well as his founding of the firm Morris & Co., had a lasting impact on decorative arts and design
### John Ruskin (supporter and theorist)
- Ruskin was an influential art critic, theorist, and patron who championed the Pre-Raphaelites for their fidelity to nature and moral seriousness
- His writings, including *Modern Painters* and *The Stones of Venice*, shaped Victorian attitudes toward art, architecture, and society
- Ruskin’s support was crucial to the early success of the Brotherhood, and his ideas on art, nature, and social responsibility had far-reaching influence
### Elizabeth Siddal
- Siddal was an artist, poet, and model closely linked to the Pre-Raphaelite circle, celebrated for her ethereal beauty and tragic life
- She posed for iconic works such as Millais’s *Ophelia* and was also a talented painter and draughtswoman in her own right
