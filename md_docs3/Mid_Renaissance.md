# Mid Renaissance
- Mid Renaissance artists aimed to make their paintings look realistic and three-dimensional
- They used techniques like linear perspective (making things look further away by drawing them smaller and converging lines), chiaroscuro (shading to create light and shadow), and careful study of human anatomy to give depth and life to their figures and scenes
- This made their art look much more like real life compared to the flat, stylised art of the Middle Ages
## Humanism and Classical Influence
- These artists were inspired by the ideas and art of ancient Greece and Rome, a movement called humanism
- They focused on people’s individuality, emotions, and achievements, often painting not just religious stories but also portraits, myths, and scenes from daily life
- Artists like Botticelli aimed for harmony, balance, and beauty, showing humans as central and important in the universe
## Innovation and Patronage
- The period saw many new artistic techniques and materials, supported by wealthy patrons like the Medici family in Florence
- Artists became more respected as creative thinkers, not just craftsmen
- They experimented with new ways to tell stories and show the world, including fresco painting, oil paints, and detailed backgrounds
- Art was commissioned for public spaces, churches, and private homes, helping spread Renaissance ideas across Italy and beyond
