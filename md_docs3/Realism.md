Realism
## Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects
### Truthful Depiction of Everyday Life
- Realist artists aimed to show the world as it truly was, without idealising or romanticising their subjects
- They painted ordinary people, workers, and real-life scenes, including the harsh or unpleasant sides of life, to give an honest view of society
### Focus on Contemporary, Working-Class Subjects
- Instead of historical, mythical, or heroic themes, Realist artists chose modern, everyday topics
- They often highlighted the lives and struggles of the working class and rural poor, making these “ordinary” people worthy subjects for serious art
### Attention to Detail and Direct Observation
- Realist painters used careful observation and photographic accuracy, capturing details of clothing, setting, and mood
- Their works often look like snapshots of real life, with natural colours and lighting, and avoided dramatic poses or exaggerated emotions
