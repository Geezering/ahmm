# Surrealism
## Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects
### Exploration of the Unconscious and Dreams
- Surrealism aimed to reveal the hidden world of the unconscious mind-the part of our brain that holds dreams, desires, and fears we are not always aware of
- Artists used techniques like automatism (creating art without conscious control) to let their imagination flow freely and bring strange, dreamlike images to life
- This made their art feel mysterious, surprising, and sometimes unsettling
### Unexpected Juxtapositions and Symbolism
- Surrealist works often combine unrelated objects or ideas in bizarre or surprising ways, creating strange scenes that challenge logic and everyday reality
- These unexpected combinations force viewers to question what they see and think beyond normal rules, often using symbols to explore themes like desire, fear, identity, and the irrational
### Rebellion Against Rationalism and Tradition
- Surrealism reacted against the strict rules of traditional art and the rational thinking that many believed had led to the horrors of World War I
- Instead, it celebrated imagination, chance, and the irrational, seeking to unite dream and reality into a “surreality” or a new kind of absolute reality that includes both conscious and unconscious experience
