# Futurism (1909–1918): Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects
# Three Short Points
## Celebration of Speed, Technology, and Modern Life
- Futurist artists like Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Gino Severini, and Giacomo Balla focused on the energy, movement, and dynamism of the modern world
- They were fascinated by machines, cars, trains, aeroplanes, and the fast pace of urban life, aiming to capture the excitement and power of new technology in their art
## Rejection of the Past and Emphasis on Change
- The Futurists wanted to break completely with tradition-they famously declared that museums were like cemeteries and called for the destruction of old art to make way for the new
- Their manifestos demanded originality, violence, and revolution, glorifying war and upheaval as ways to sweep aside outdated ideas and celebrate the future
## Innovative Artistic Techniques to Show Movement
- To express speed and motion, Futurist artists used techniques such as blurring, repetition, and “lines of force” (strong lines showing direction and energy, borrowed from Cubism)
- Their works often appear fragmented, with bright colours and overlapping forms that suggest things are moving or vibrating
- They worked across painting, sculpture, literature, music, and even architecture to spread their vision of a dynamic, ever-changing world
# Contextual information
## Main location(s):
- Italy, especially Milan, Turin, and Naples
## Relevant previous art movements:
- Neo-Impressionism and Cubism (influenced their techniques and use of colour and form)
- Symbolism and Realism (Futurists reacted against their focus on the past and sentimentality)
## Relevant culture and politics:
- **Early 20th-century Italy:** rapid industrialisation, political unrest, and a desire for national renewal
- Many Futurists supported radical politics and Italian nationalism, and some later aligned with Fascism
- The First World War had a huge impact, both inspiring and later disillusioning many Futurists
# Relevant writers and Composers:
## Writers:
- Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (poet and founder of Futurism, wrote the Futurist Manifesto)
## Composers:
- Luigi Russolo (created experimental “noise music”), Francesco Balilla Pratella
# Contemporary inventions and technology:
- Automobiles (cars), trains, aeroplanes 
- New printing and mass media technologies
- Electric lighting and industrial machinery
## Typical fashions of the day for men and women:
- **Men:** Tailored suits, hats, and ties (urban, modern look)
- **Women:**  Long dresses, elaborate hats, but gradually moving towards simpler, more practical styles reflecting the new, energetic age
## ## ## Artists and Period- Period: 1909–1918
# Key Artists:
### Filippo Tommaso Marinetti
- Marinetti was the founder and chief theorist of Futurism, writing the "Futurist Manifesto" in 1909, which called for the rejection of tradition and the celebration of speed, technology, and modernity
- He promoted art that glorified violence, dynamism, and the energy of the machine age, seeing war as a means of societal renewal
- Marinetti’s radical ideas and manifestos inspired and united the Futurist artists, shaping the movement’s aggressive, avant-garde spirit
### Umberto Boccioni
- Boccioni was a leading Futurist painter and sculptor, known for capturing movement, energy, and the dynamism of modern life in both two and three dimensions
- His works, such as "Unique Forms of Continuity in Space," broke down solid forms to convey speed and fluidity, reflecting the influence of Cubism but with a focus on motion
- Boccioni’s theoretical writings and innovative art helped define Futurism’s visual language and its emphasis on the transformation of reality through technology
### Carlo Carrà
- Carrà was a key figure in the Futurist movement, renowned for using bold colours, fragmented forms, and dynamic compositions to express the chaos and energy of contemporary urban life
- He sought to convey "dynamic simultaneity," representing multiple states of mind and movement within a single image, as seen in works like "The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli"
- Carrà’s art and manifestos contributed to Futurism’s focus on modernity, revolution, and the depiction of motion, while later in his career he played a role in the development of Metaphysical painting
### Gino Severini
- Severini’s Futurist paintings often depicted scenes of dance, nightlife, and urban excitement, using rhythmic lines and vibrant colours to evoke movement and energy
- He was instrumental in introducing Futurism to the Parisian avant-garde and integrating elements of Cubism and Divisionism into the movement
- Severini’s work explored the relationship between art, music, and the mechanised rhythms of modern life, contributing to the international reach of Futurism
### Giacomo Balla
- Balla was a pioneer in expressing speed, light, and motion through abstract forms, often using repeated lines and fragmented shapes to suggest movement
- His works, such as "Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash," exemplify the Futurist fascination with capturing fleeting moments and the mechanics of motion
- Balla’s experiments with colour, form, and kinetic art made him a central figure in both the theoretical and practical development of Futurism
# Glossary for Students
- **Dynamism:** The quality of being full of energy and movement
- **Manifesto:** A public declaration of beliefs or aims
- **Lines of force:** Strong lines in art that show direction, energy, or movement
- **Fragmented:** Broken into pieces or parts, often to suggest motion or chaos.
