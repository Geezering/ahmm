# Suprematism
## Pure Abstraction and Geometric Forms
- Suprematism is all about pure abstraction-art that doesn’t try to show real objects or people
- Instead, artists used basic geometric shapes like squares, circles, and rectangles, often painted in bold, flat colours
- This style is called non-objective art, meaning it has no connection to the physical world-just shapes and colours for their own sake
## Supremacy of Feeling and Spirituality
- The movement’s founder, Kazimir Malevich, believed that art should express pure artistic feeling, not copy the outside world
- Suprematist works aimed to connect with viewers on a spiritual level, using simplicity and harmony to evoke deep emotions and a sense of higher existence
## Minimalism and the “Zero Point” of Art
- Suprematists stripped art down to its essentials, using limited colour palettes (often just black, white, red, and primary colours) and avoiding any sense of depth or storytelling
- Malevich called this the “zero degree” of painting-the idea of starting fresh with no reference to the past, just pure form and colour

# Three Short Points for Students
Suprematism used simple geometric shapes and pure colours to create totally abstract art, with no link to the real world
- The movement aimed to express pure feeling and spiritual ideas, believing that art could connect us to something higher than everyday life
- Suprematist artists stripped away all detail, focusing on minimalism and the “zero point” of painting-a radical break from tradition that influenced modern art
