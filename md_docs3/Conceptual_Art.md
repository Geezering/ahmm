- Questioned who gets to decide what art is, often working as a group rather than as individuals
- Their work made viewers think about the process of making and understanding art, not just the final object
### Vito Acconci
- Used his own body and actions as art, often in performances that tested personal limits or social boundaries
- Explored ideas about public and private space, sometimes making viewers feel uncomfortable or involved
- His work focused on the idea behind the action, not on creating a lasting object
### Marina Abramović
- Pioneered performance art, using her body in challenging and sometimes dangerous ways to explore endurance, trust, and audience participation
- Her work often questioned the limits of art and the relationship between artist and viewer
- Emphasised the concept and experience over any physical artwork
### John Baldessari
- Combined images and text to challenge how we interpret pictures and language
- Used humour and irony to question what makes something “art.”
- Often instructed others to make his work, showing that the idea matters more than who physically creates it
### Joseph Beuys
- Joseph Beuys expanded the boundaries of Conceptual art by emphasising the social and political potential of art, famously declaring that “everyone is an artist.”
- His performances, installations, and lectures often used symbolic materials and actions to provoke thought about healing, democracy, and human rights
- Beuys’s work blurred the line between art and life, making the creative process itself a form of social sculpture
### Marcel Broodthaers

- Broodthaers’s witty, cerebral approach made him a key figure in the European Conceptual art scene
### Chris Burden
- Chris Burden became known for his radical performances that tested the limits of physical endurance and personal risk, such as being shot or confined in small spaces
- His work questioned the role of the artist, the audience, and the boundaries of art itself
- Burden’s actions highlighted the importance of ideas and experiences over traditional art objects
### Daniel Buren

- He challenges the conventions of art display and the authority of museums and galleries
- Buren’s conceptual practice focuses on the relationship between artwork, environment, and viewer perception
### Sophie Calle
- Sophie Calle’s work blends autobiography, investigation, and narrative, using photography, text, and installation to explore themes of identity and intimacy
- She often involves real-life events and other people’s stories, blurring the boundary between art and life

- Her work often involves direct engagement with the audience, prompting self-reflection and social critique
- Piper’s intellectual rigour and personal vulnerability have made her a pioneering voice in Conceptual and political art
### Felix Gonzalez-Torres
- Felix Gonzalez-Torres created minimalist installations using everyday materials like sweets, clocks, and light bulbs to explore themes of love, loss, and memory
- His works invite audience participation, allowing viewers to take pieces away and thus engage with the concept of impermanence
- Gonzalez-Torres’s art is deeply emotional and conceptual, focusing on the power of simple gestures and shared experiences
### Dan Graham
- Dan Graham’s art investigates the relationship between the viewer,the artwork, and the architectural space, often using glass, mirrors, and video
- He is known for his theoretical writings and installations that challenge perceptions of time, space, and self
- Graham’s conceptual practice bridges art, architecture, and social commentary
### Hans Haacke
- Hans Haacke is a leading figure in institutional critique, using research-based installations to expose the political and economic structures behind art institutions
- His works often involve data, documentation, and real-world events, making viewers aware of the systems that shape culture

## In Simple Terms for Students
## Conceptual Art
- Is about the idea behind the artwork, not how it looks or what it’s made from[1][2][3][4][5][7]
- The artists often used ordinary materials, words, or actions to get their ideas across, sometimes making art that anyone could recreate by following instructions[1][2]
- Their work makes us question what art is, who decides, and whether the object itself matters, or if the idea is enough
