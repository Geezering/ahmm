# Early Renaissance (1450–1550): 
- Key Facts and Context
## Main location(s):  
- Florence and other cities in central Italy were the heart of the Early Renaissance
- Florence was especially known for its artistic innovation and the support of patrons like the Medici family[1][8]
## Relevant previous art movements: 
- Gothic and Romanesque art (characterised by flat, stylised figures and religious themes)
- Proto-Renaissance (artists like Giotto and Duccio began to move towards naturalism and three-dimensionality in the 1300s)[1]
## Relevant culture and politics: 
- The rise of Humanism (a philosophy focusing on human potential, individuality, and the study of classical antiquity)
- Growth of wealthy merchant families (like the Medici) who became important patrons of the arts[1][8]
- Increasing interest in science, mathematics, and anatomy, which influenced artists’ approach to realism and perspective[1][5]
# Relevant writers and Composers:
## Writers: 
- Dante Alighieri
- Petrarch, and Boccaccio (early Humanist writers);
- Leon Battista Alberti (art theorist)
## Composers:
 - Guillaume Dufay
 - Josquin des Prez (early Renaissance composers who brought innovation to sacred and secular music)
## Contemporary Inventions and Technology: 
- Development of linear perspective (using mathematics to create the illusion of depth on a flat surface)[1][4]
- Advances in anatomy and scientific observation, leading to more realistic human figures[5]
- Introduction of oil painting techniques (from Northern Europe), and innovations in fresco and tempera painting[1][4]
- The printing press (invented in the mid-15th century), which helped spread new ideas quickly
## Typical fashions of the day for men and women:  
- **Men:** Doublets (close-fitting jackets), hose (tight trousers), long tunics, and hats or caps
- **Women:**  Long dresses with fitted bodices, high waistlines, and elaborate sleeves; hair often covered or braided with decorative nets or veils
# Artists and Period:  
- **Giotto** (active c. 1300–1337), often considered Proto-Renaissance but hugely influential on the Early Renaissance [1]
- **Duccio** (active c. 1278–1319), Proto-Renaissance, but his innovations set the stage for later artists
- **Masaccio** (1401–1428), a key Early Renaissance painter[1][3][6]
- **Paolo Uccello** (1397–1475), Early Renaissance, famous for his use of perspective [1][4]
## Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects
### Giotto
#### Naturalism and Emotion:
  Giotto broke away from the flat, stylised figures of medieval art, giving his figures weight, volume, and real human emotion
- His frescoes, like those in the Scrovegni Chapel, show people with believable gestures and faces[1]
- **Three-Dimensional Space:** He was one of the first to create the illusion of depth, making figures appear to stand in real space rather than float on a flat background[1]
- **Storytelling:** Giotto’s scenes are clear and dramatic, making complex religious stories easy to understand through expressive poses and simple, powerful compositions
### Duccio
#### Transition from Medieval to Renaissance:
- Duccio’s work bridges the gap between the Gothic style and the new realism of the Renaissance, introducing softer lines and more naturalistic figures
#### Detailed Narrative Panels: 
- He often painted large altarpieces made up of many small panels, each telling a different part of a religious story
- **Use of Colour and Texture:** Duccio used rich colours and delicate patterns to give his paintings a sense of beauty and luxury, while still moving towards more realistic space and figures
### Masaccio
#### Pioneering Perspective:
- Masaccio was the first to use linear perspective consistently, making his paintings look convincingly three-dimensional[1][4]
**** Realistic Human Figures:
- He painted people with accurate anatomy and natural poses, using light and shadow (chiaroscuro) to model their bodies and faces[1]
#### Emotional and Spiritual Depth:
- Masaccio’s frescoes, like those in the Brancacci Chapel, combine realism with deep emotion, making religious stories feel immediate and human[3]
### Paolo Uccello
#### Obsession with Perspective:
- Uccello used mathematics to create dramatic, almost puzzle-like scenes with precise, geometric perspective (as in his famous “Battle of San Romano”)[1][4]
#### Fusion of Gothic and Renaissance:
- His work blends the decorative detail of Gothic art with the new scientific approach to space and form
#### Dynamic Composition:
- Uccello’s paintings are full of movement and energy, using foreshortening (making objects look shorter to show depth) and unusual viewpoints
## In Simple Terms for Students
- Early Renaissance artists wanted to make art look real, using maths and science to show depth, light, and anatomy accurately
- They were inspired by ancient Greek and Roman art, but also wanted to show real human emotions and everyday life, not just religious stories
- Their new techniques changed art forever, making paintings and frescoes feel alive, believable, and full of meaning
# Three Short Points for Each Artist
## Giotto
1. Created lifelike, emotional figures
2. Used shading and perspective for depth
3. Told clear, dramatic stories in his art
## Duccio
1. Bridged Gothic and Renaissance styles
2. Painted detailed narrative panels
3. Used rich colour and gentle realism
## Masaccio
1. Mastered linear perspective for 3D space
2. Painted realistic, anatomically correct people
3. Brought emotion and humanity to religious scenes 
## Uccello
1. Explored mathematical perspective in art 
2. Mixed Gothic detail with Renaissance science
3. Created dynamic, energetic compositions
## The impact
- The Early Renaissance was a time of huge change, where artists like Giotto, Duccio, Masaccio, and Uccello set the foundations for modern art by making paintings more realistic, emotional, and connected to the real world[1][3][4][7]
