Romantic
## Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects
### Emotion, Imagination, and Individualism
- Romantic artists put strong feelings, imagination, and personal vision at the centre of their work
- They believed art should express the artist’s own emotions and inner world, rather than follow strict rules or imitate classical models
- This led to dramatic, powerful images and a sense of originality and freedom in their art
### Nature and the Sublime
- Nature was a major inspiration, shown as beautiful, wild, and sometimes terrifying
- Romantic artists often painted dramatic landscapes, storms, and ruins to evoke awe and wonder (the “sublime” means something so impressive or vast it makes you feel small)
- Nature was seen as a source of truth and spiritual renewal, and a refuge from the problems of modern, industrial society
### Rebellion, Nationalism, and the Past
- Romanticism was a reaction against the rational thinking of the Enlightenment and the changes of the Industrial Revolution
- Artists often celebrated national identity, folklore, and the heroism of the past, especially the Middle Ages
- Many works also showed rebellion against authority and explored themes of freedom, justice, and the struggles of ordinary people
