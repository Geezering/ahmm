# New objectivity
## Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects
### Unsentimental Realism and Social Critique
- New Objectivity artists rejected the emotional drama of Expressionism, choosing instead to show the world with clear, sharp realism
- They depicted everyday life and the harsh realities of post-World War I Germany, often focusing on themes like poverty, corruption, and the struggles of ordinary people
- Their works were often bleak, satirical, and critical of society, exposing injustice and moral decay
### Detached, Analytical Style
- The movement is known for its sober, unemotional approach
- Artists painted with precise detail and clarity, favouring rigid, static compositions and cool observation over dramatic or romantic effects
- This detachment highlighted the alienation and cynicism of the time, reflecting the disillusionment felt by many after the war
### Documenting Modern Life and Urban Change
- New Objectivity artists often portrayed the rapid changes in urban life, the rise of the metropolis, and the alienation of individuals in modern society
- They painted a wide range of subjects-from city workers and war veterans to prostitutes and politicians-capturing the instability, inequality, and complexity of Weimar Republic life
