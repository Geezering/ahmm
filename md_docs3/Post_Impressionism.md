Post Impressionism
## Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects
### Personal Expression and Emotional Impact
- Post-Impressionist artists moved beyond simply capturing what they saw, focusing instead on expressing their own feelings, memories, and ideas through their art
- They often used bold, unnatural colours and dramatic brushstrokes to show emotion or mood, rather than just copying real life
### Experimentation with Form, Colour, and Structure
- Many Post-Impressionists experimented with geometric shapes, patterns, and new ways of organising their paintings
- Some, like Cézanne, used structured brushwork and simplified forms, while others, like Seurat and Signac, developed pointillism (painting with tiny dots of colour)
### Symbolism and Abstraction
- Post-Impressionists often included symbolic or abstract elements in their work, using colour, shape, and composition to suggest deeper meanings or personal stories
- This set the stage for later movements like Cubism and Expressionism, as artists became more interested in what art could mean, not just what it could show
