# Fauvism (1904–1907): Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects
# Three Short Points
## Bold, Unnatural Colour and Expressive Brushwork
Fauvist artists like Henri Matisse, André Derain, and Maurice de Vlaminck used pure, vivid colours straight from the tube, often in unexpected ways-trees could be blue, faces green, skies red
- Their brushstrokes were energetic and sometimes rough, creating a sense of movement and emotion rather than aiming for realism
- Colour was used to express feeling, not to copy what things actually look like in real life
## Simplified Forms and Spontaneous Composition
The Fauves rejected traditional rules about perspective and shading
- They simplified shapes and often made their paintings look flat, with little attempt to show depth or realistic light and shadow
- Their compositions were spontaneous and impulsive, with quick, gestural lines and a focus on the artist’s personal response to the subject, rather than careful planning or detail
## Rebellion Against Tradition and Focus on Individual Expression
Fauvism was a radical break from the past, inspired by Post-Impressionists like Van Gogh and Gauguin but going further in freeing colour and form from their traditional roles
- The movement encouraged artists to paint what they felt, not just what they saw, making each work a powerful expression of the artist’s own emotions and imagination
- This approach shocked viewers at the time and led to the artists being nicknamed “wild beasts” (les fauves) because of their untamed style
# Contextual information
## Main location(s): 
- France, especially Paris and the Mediterranean coast

## ## Artists and Period
- **Period:** 1904–1907 (core years for Fauvism)
## Key Artists:
### Henri Matisse
- Matisse was the leader of Fauvism, known for his use of bold, emotive colours, simplified shapes, and expressive brushwork that broke away from traditional representation
- He often exaggerated colours to convey emotion rather than depict reality, and his work ranged from vibrant paintings to innovative paper cut-outs in later years
- Matisse’s approach prioritised the arrangement of colour planes and decorative composition, making his art joyful, energetic, and highly influential within the movement
### Maurice Vlaminck
- Vlaminck was a "natural" Fauvist whose exuberant personality matched his intense, vivid use of colour, influenced by seeing Van Gogh’s work
- His paintings are marked by impulsive brushwork and a raw, emotional response to nature, often using non-naturalistic colours to heighten expression
- Vlaminck’s approach was spontaneous and energetic, helping to define the wild, untamed spirit of Fauvism
### André Derain
- Derain, working closely with Matisse, introduced unnaturalistic colour and vivid brushstrokes to his landscapes and portraits, especially during their time in Collioure
- His style balanced the impulsiveness of Vlaminck with the control of Matisse, resulting in vibrant yet harmonious compositions
- Derain’s Fauvist works are known for their decorative use of colour and simplified forms, though he later moved towards a more restrained palette and structure
### Georges Braque
- Braque joined the Fauves in 1906, adopting their use of pure, intense colour and loose, expressive brushwork
- His Fauvist period was brief, as he soon became a pioneer of Cubism, but his early works display the movement’s characteristic vibrancy and emotional directness
- Braque’s Fauvist paintings often focused on landscape, using colour as a primary means of expression rather than realistic depiction
### Raoul Dufy
- Dufy was drawn to the bright palette and decorative qualities of Fauvism, creating lively scenes full of light and movement
- His work is characterised by fluid lines, simplified shapes, and a joyful, optimistic use of colour
- Dufy’s Fauvist style brought a sense of playfulness and spontaneity to the movement, particularly in his depictions of leisure and coastal life
### Kees van Dongen
- Van Dongen was known for his striking portraits, using exaggerated colours and bold outlines to heighten emotional impact
- His Fauvist works often depicted nightlife, performers, and fashionable women, rendered with a vivid, sometimes provocative palette
- Van Dongen’s approach embodied the wild and expressive energy of Fauvism, making his paintings instantly recognisable
### Georges Rouault
- Rouault’s Fauvist paintings combined intense colour with heavy black outlines, giving his figures a stained-glass appearance
- He focused on deeply emotional and spiritual subjects, using the Fauvist palette to convey inner turmoil and compassion
- Rouault’s work stands out for its sombre mood and expressive distortion, showing the movement’s potential for psychological depth
### Albert Marquet
- Marquet’s Fauvist works are noted for their subtle yet vibrant use of colour and simplified, fluid forms
- He often painted landscapes and cityscapes, capturing light and atmosphere with broad, expressive brushstrokes
- Marquet’s contribution to Fauvism was a quieter, more contemplative approach, balancing the movement’s exuberance with a sense of calm
