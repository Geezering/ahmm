## Inspiration from Ancient Greece and Rome
![The Oath of the Horatii](/myrepo/images/premodern/neoclassical/8horatii.jpg)

- Neoclassical artists looked back to the art, architecture, and stories of ancient Greece and Rome
- They used classical themes, such as myths, heroic figures, and historical events, aiming for harmony, simplicity, and ideal beauty
- Their works often show balanced, symmetrical compositions and calm, ordered scenes, avoiding the drama and decoration of the earlier Baroque and Rococo styles
## Emphasis on Line, Clarity, and Moral Virtue

- Neoclassical art is known for its clear outlines, smooth surfaces, and restrained use of colour
- Artists valued drawing (line) more than painting (colour) and focused on precise, controlled technique
- Many paintings and sculptures have a serious, unemotional (sometimes called “austere”) look and often tell stories about duty, sacrifice, or the importance of moral values
## Historical Accuracy and Contemporary Relevance
- Artists aimed to show costumes, settings, and details as accurately as possible, based on archaeological discoveries and studies of classical art
- At the same time, they used ancient stories to comment on their own times, especially during political events like the French Revolution
- For example, Jacques-Louis David’s paintings celebrated republican values and heroism, linking ancient Rome to the struggles for liberty in France
