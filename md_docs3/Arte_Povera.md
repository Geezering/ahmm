- Used simple, everyday materials and involved others in the making of his works, questioning the idea of the artist as a lone genius[2][7]
- His art often played with duality and contradiction, such as splitting his name into "Alighiero e Boetti" to suggest two identities[7]
### Luciano Fabro
- Elevated humble, found materials (like newspaper, glass, or tiles) to the status of art, challenging traditional ideas of value and skill[8]
- His works often made viewers question what is precious or important in art, for example, by presenting a spotless floor as a work of art[8]
- Focused on the conceptual side of art, making the viewer think about the meaning and context of everyday objects[8]
