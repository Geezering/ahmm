# Baroque / dDtch Golden Age art: Key themes, ideas, and artistic aspects
# Three short points
- realism, detail, and everyday life
- Dutch Golden Age and baroque artists like Rembrandt, Vermeer, Frans Hals, and Pieter de Hooch were renowned for their incredible realism and attention to detail
- They painted ordinary people, bustling markets, and domestic interiors with lifelike textures and subtle lighting, making everyday life and the natural world worthy subjects for art
- This realism was a hallmark of the period, with artists carefully observing and recording the world around them
# Diversity of subjects and symbolism
- **Unlike earlier periods, Dutch artists specialised in a wide variety of subjects:** 
- Portraits, landscapes, seascapes, still lifes, and genre scenes (scenes of daily life)
- Still lifes and domestic scenes often included hidden symbolism-like a wilting flower symbolising the shortness of life or a lavish banquet showing wealth and its fleeting nature
- These paintings reflected the values, prosperity, and interests of the growing Dutch middle class
# Light, drama, and emotional impact
- Baroque artists across Europe, such as Caravaggio, Rubens, and Artemisia Gentileschi, used dramatic contrasts of light and shadow (called chiaroscuro) and dynamic compositions to create a sense of movement and emotion
- Even in the Dutch context, artists like Rembrandt mastered the play of light to give portraits and scenes a powerful, almost theatrical presence, drawing viewers into the emotional world of the painting
