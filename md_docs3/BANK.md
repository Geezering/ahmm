# BANK (Artist Collective)
## Overview and Reputation
  - BANK was a London-based artists' collective active primarily in the 1990s, notorious for its irreverent, satirical, and confrontational approach to the art world[1][3][5]
- The group targeted the commercialisation, elitism, and jargon of the contemporary art scene, using exhibitions, publications, and direct interventions to critique and parody the art establishment[1][3]
- Their reputation at the time was divisive: widely ignored by the mainstream art press (notably Frieze and Art Monthly), they were nonetheless infamous among artists and galleries for their relentless and often abrasive institutional critique[1][3][5]
- Today, BANK’s legacy is recognised as radical and influential, with their archive and exhibitions still seen as potent, unique, and largely unimitated[1]
## Key Members and Contributions
  - **Simon Bedwell**: A founding member, central to the group’s conceptual direction, and tone
- Like all the core members, Bedwell helped shape BANK’s satirical manifestos, tabloid-style publications, and the infamous "Fax-Baks"—mocked-up corrections of gallery press releases sent back to their sources as a form of institutional critique[1][3][5]
- **John Russell**: Early collaborator with Bedwell, involved in the merging of artist groups that became BANK
- Russell contributed to the group’s exhibitions and helped develop their collaborative, anti-authorial approach[5]
- **Milly Thompson**: Core member, responsible for archiving BANK’s output and curatorial contributions to later exhibitions
- Thompson also helped maintain the group’s distinctive visual and textual style[1]
- **Andrew Williamson**: Contributing to exhibitions and the group’s critical discourse and offered reflections on the group’s internal culture and boundaries[1]
- **David (Dave) Burrows**: Sometime-member, known for his participation in two early BANK shows and performances
- Burrows brought an outsider’s perspective and contributed to the group’s dynamic and occasionally contentious internal debates[1][3]
## Notable Projects and Methods
- **Cocaine Orgasm (often rendered as 'Cocaine Rogasm'):** 
This was a satirical and provocative exhibition staged by BANK in the 1990s
- The show lampooned the excesses and hedonism of the contemporary art world, particularly the Young British Artists (YBAs) scene, by using themes of drug culture, sensationalism, and tabloid aesthetics
- The exhibition’s title and content were deliberately confrontational, aiming to parody both the art market’s obsession with notoriety and the media’s appetite for scandal
- **Zombie Golf:** This exhibition was another example of BANK’s irreverent approach, using absurdity and black humour to critique art-world trends and the commodification of creativity
- The show likely featured installations and performances that played with the idea of mindless repetition (as in “zombies”) and the leisure industry (golf), satirising the emptiness of certain art practices and the art market’s cyclical nature
- Like many BANK projects, it was designed to be chaotic, funny, and critical of contemporary art’s pretensions
- **The Charge of the Light Brigade:** BANK’s exhibition by this name used the famous military disaster as a metaphor for the quixotic, doomed, or misguided efforts of artists and institutions in the art world
- The show’s title evokes themes of heroism, futility, and blind obedience—qualities BANK often parodied in their critique of the art establishment
- The exhibition included collaborative installations, paintings, satirical texts, and performative elements, all designed to lampoon the seriousness and self-importance of the art industry
### BANK's "Fuck Off" Exhibition
- The exhibition titled **"Fuck Off"** was staged by the BANK collective in 1996 in London, continuing their tradition of aggressive, immersive, and polemical group shows that satirised and critiqued the contemporary art scene of the 1990s[1][2][3]
- It was part of a series of exhibitions with provocative titles such as *Zombie Golf* and *Cocaine Orgasm*, designed to lampoon the art world’s pretensions, commercialism, and hype[1]
- Like their other shows, *Fuck Off* was held in temporary warehouse spaces (e.g., BANKSPACE, DOG, Galerie Poo-Poo), featuring sprawling installations that combined humour, chaos, and institutional critique
- The exhibition included contributions from a range of artists associated with BANK and the wider London scene, such as Martin Creed, Peter Doig, Matthew Higgs, Chris Ofili, Gavin Turk, and others[1]
- The show’s title, *Fuck Off*, encapsulated the collective’s anarchic and confrontational stance toward the art establishment, reflecting a refusal to conform to the expectations and etiquette of galleries, critics, and the commercial art market[1][2]
- BANK’s approach involved "anti-curating," deliberately subverting conventional exhibition formats and promotional strategies to expose the art world’s contradictions and absurdities[2]
- BANK’s infamous "Fax-Bak" project—sending back corrected and sarcastic versions of gallery press releases—exemplified the same spirit of institutional critique present in *Fuck Off* and other exhibitions[1][2]
- The exhibition was part of a broader practice that combined lowbrow humour, punk-like attitude, and serious critique, making *Fuck Off* a memorable moment in 1990s British contemporary art
- **The reception at the time was mixed:** largely ignored or dismissed by mainstream art press but influential and notorious within artist circles and alternative art spaces[1][2][3]
- Today, *Fuck Off* is seen as emblematic of BANK’s unique legacy—radical, funny, and still potent as a critique of art-world systems[2]
- BANK’s *Fuck Off* exhibition (1996) was a quintessential example of their anarchic institutional critique, using provocative titles, immersive installations, and satirical strategies to challenge the art world’s commercialism and pretension
- It remains a significant episode in the history of British artist-led practice and the Young British Artists era

###"Fax-Bak"
- BANK’s most infamous project was the "Fax-Bak" series, in which they returned gallery press releases with sarcastic, pedantic, and often rude corrections, lampooning the pretentiousness and vacuity of art-world language[1][2]
- They also produced a satirical magazine with headlines mocking the art establishment and its personalities[3]
- Their exhibitions, such as “STOP SHORT-CHANGING US
- POPULAR CULTURE IS FOR IDIOTS
- WE BELIEVE IN ART.”, were deliberately shambolic, funny, and provocative, aiming to disrupt the norms of curation and promotion[1]
- BANK’s approach was collaborative but often described as "dysfunctional," with a "surly, self-destructive, self-conscious, introspective attitude" that was both critical and self-critical[3][5]
## Reputation Then and Now
  - At the time, BANK was seen as a troublemaking, outsider force, largely ignored by the prestige art press but notorious within the London art scene for their relentless satire and refusal to play by the rules of the burgeoning YBA era[1][3][5]
- Their work was sometimes dismissed as mere mischief, but members insist it was a serious continuation of avant-garde critique, especially at a time when the art market and curatorial industry were becoming increasingly dominant[1]
- In retrospect, BANK’s work is regarded as prescient and still relevant, especially in its critique of art-world professionalisation and jargon
- Their archive is seen as unique and potent, with a level of radicalism and humour that remains largely unplagiarised[1]
- While some of their offensiveness is now viewed as tame, their willingness to "say the unsayable" and challenge institutional norms has secured their place in the history of British contemporary art[1][3][5]
- > "BANK seems to still stand for radicalism – I’m surprised at the continuing level of interest (and delighted), the work we made still doesn’t look like anything else I think, and maybe there’s potency in something that has not been sort of plagiarised in one way or another." – Milly Thompson[1]
