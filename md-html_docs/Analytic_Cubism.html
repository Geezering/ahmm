<h1 id="artists-and-period">Artists And Period:</h1>
<h3 id="pablo-picasso">Pablo Picasso</h3>
<ul>
<li>Picasso was a co-founder of Cubism, pioneering the movement
alongside Georges Braque and radically changing the way artists
represented reality</li>
<li>He explored multiple viewpoints in a single image, breaking objects
into geometric forms and reassembling them in abstracted
compositions</li>
<li>Picasso’s work in both Analytic and Synthetic Cubism introduced
collage, text, and new materials into fine art</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="georges-braque">Georges Braque</h3>
<ul>
<li>Braque worked closely with Picasso to develop Cubism, especially the
Analytic phase, emphasising muted colours and the fragmentation of
form</li>
<li>He was interested in the relationship between objects and space,
often painting still lifes that challenge traditional perspective</li>
<li>Braque’s use of texture, stencilled letters, and trompe-l’œil
effects played a key role in the evolution of Cubist techniques</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="juan-gris">Juan Gris</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gris brought a more structured and precise approach to Cubism, using
clear lines and bright, harmonious colours</li>
<li>He is known for his Synthetic Cubist works, which often feature
collage elements and a careful balance of composition</li>
<li>Gris’s art helped to clarify and popularise Cubist ideas, making
them more accessible and decorative</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fernand-léger">Fernand Léger</h3>
<ul>
<li>Léger’s version of Cubism was more mechanical and dynamic, often
incorporating cylindrical forms and bold contrasts</li>
<li>He was fascinated by modern life and technology, reflecting these
themes in his Cubist paintings of machines, cities, and workers</li>
<li>Léger’s style, sometimes called “Tubism,” influenced later movements
such as Purism and modern graphic design</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="robert-delaunay">Robert Delaunay</h3>
<ul>
<li>Delaunay developed a colourful, abstract form of Cubism known as
Orphism, focusing on the interplay of light and colour</li>
<li>He explored the fragmentation of form but placed greater emphasis on
rhythm and movement within his compositions</li>
<li>Delaunay’s vibrant works, especially his series on the Eiffel Tower,
helped expand Cubism into pure abstraction</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="albert-gleizes">Albert Gleizes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gleizes was both a painter and a theorist, helping to define and
spread Cubist ideas through his writing and teaching</li>
<li>His works often feature large, interlocking planes and a strong
sense of rhythm and movement</li>
<li>Gleizes believed Cubism should reflect the modern world and
collective experience, rather than individual perception</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jean-metzinger">Jean Metzinger</h3>
<ul>
<li>Metzinger was instrumental in developing the theoretical foundations
of Cubism, co-authoring the influential book “Du Cubisme” with
Gleizes</li>
<li>His paintings combine multiple perspectives and fractured forms with
a refined, decorative sense of colour and pattern</li>
<li>Metzinger’s approach helped bridge the gap between early Cubist
experimentation and its broader acceptance in the art world</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="marcel-duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</h3>
<ul>
<li>Duchamp’s Cubist works, such as “Nude Descending a Staircase,
No</li>
<li>2,” introduced movement and time as key elements in the style</li>
<li>He pushed the boundaries of Cubism by blending it with Futurist
ideas and questioning the very nature of art</li>
<li>Duchamp’s innovations paved the way for Dada, conceptual art, and
other avant-garde movements</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-themes-ideas-and-artistic-aspects">Key Themes, Ideas, And
Artistic Aspects</h2>
<h3 id="pablo-picasso-1">Pablo Picasso</h3>
<ul>
<li>Broke Down Objects And People Into Geometric Shapes And Overlapping
Planes, Showing Them From Several Viewpoints At Once[1][2][3]</li>
<li>Used A Limited Colour Palette (Mainly Browns, Greys, And Ochres) To
Focus Attention On Form And Structure, Not On Bright Colours[2][5]</li>
<li>Challenged Traditional Art By Making Viewers Work To “Read” The
Painting, Turning Looking At Art Into An Active Process[1][3]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="georges-braque-1">Georges Braque</h3>
<ul>
<li>Worked Closely With Picasso, Developing The Style Together So Their
Paintings From This Period Look Very Similar[4][5]</li>
<li>Focused On Still Life Subjects (Like Musical Instruments And
Bottles), Dissecting Them Into Fragments And Reassembling Them In
Complex, Dense Compositions[4][1]</li>
<li>Emphasised The Flatness Of The Canvas, Using Overlapping Planes And
Subtle Colours To Blur The Line Between Background And
Foreground[2][3]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="juan-gris-1">Juan Gris</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brought A More Structured, Precise Approach To Analytic Cubism,
Often Making The Fragmented Forms Clearer And More Organised[6][7]</li>
<li>Used Slightly Brighter Colours And Clearer Shapes Than Picasso And
Braque, Making His Cubist Works Easier To “Read.”</li>
<li>Helped Bridge The Gap Between Analytic And Later Synthetic Cubism,
Influencing The Movement’s Next Phase[6][7]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-simple-terms-for-students">In Simple Terms For Students</h2>
<h3 id="analytic-cubism">Analytic Cubism:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Was About Breaking Down Objects Into Parts And Showing Them From
Many Angles At Once, Like Looking At Something Through A Shattered
Mirror[2][3]</p></li>
<li><p>Artists Used Dull Colours So The Viewer Would Focus On Shapes,
Lines, And Structure, Not On Colour[2][3][5]</p></li>
<li><p>Paintings Often Look Busy And Complicated In The Centre, Making
You Look Closely And Think About What You’re Seeing[2][3]</p></li>
