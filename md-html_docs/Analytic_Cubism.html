  <span class="year">1910</span>
</span>
<ul>
  <li>Co-founder of Cubism, alongside Georges Braque.</li>
  <li>Broke down objects and people into geometric shapes and overlapping planes to show several viewpoints at once.</li>
  <li>Used limited colours (browns, greys, ochres) to focus on form and structure, not bright palettes.</li>
  <li>Challenged viewers to work to “read” the painting, making looking at art an active process.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="georges-braque">Georges Braque</h3>

</span>
<ul>
  <li>Collaborated closely with Picasso in developing Analytic Cubism; their paintings looked very similar in this phase.</li>
  <li>Favoured still life subjects (musical instruments, bottles), dissecting and reassembling them into complex, overlapping fragments.</li>
  <li>Emphasised the flatness of the canvas, with overlapping planes and muted colours that blur background and foreground.</li>
  <li>Used texture, stencilled letters, and trompe-l’œil effects, expanding Cubist possibilities.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Brought clarity, structure and bright, harmonious colour to Cubism.</li>
  <li>His Cubist works use clearer lines and slightly brighter colours than Picasso or Braque, making them easier to interpret.</li>

  <li>Blended Cubism with Futurist ideas and questioned what art could be.</li>
  <li>Paved the way for Dada, conceptual art, and the avant-garde.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="key-themes-ideas">Key Themes and Artistic Aspects</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Multiple viewpoints:</strong> Objects are broken down into geometric shapes and shown from different angles at once (like seeing through a shattered mirror).</li>
  <li><strong>Limited colour palette:</strong> Mostly browns, greys, and ochres, to focus attention on form and structure.</li>
  <li><strong>Active viewing:</strong> Paintings are complex and detailed, encouraging close looking and interpretation rather than immediate recognition.</li>
  <li><strong>Emphasis on flatness:</strong> Overlapping planes and subtle colours blur the line between background and foreground, making viewers aware of the two-dimensional surface.</li>
  <li><strong>Fragmentation:</strong> Forms are dissected and reconstructed in abstracted, busy compositions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cubism-simply">Analytic Cubism: In Simple Terms for Students</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Breaks down objects into parts and shows them from many angles at once, like seeing something through a shattered mirror.</li>
  <li>Artists used dull colours so you focus on the shapes, lines, and structure, not on bright colours.</li>
  <li>The paintings often look busy or complicated, especially at the centre, so you have to look closely and think about what you see.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="related-writers-composers">Related Writers and Composers</h2>
