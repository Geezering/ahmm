Artistic Aspects</h2>
<h3 id="exploration-of-the-unconscious-and-dreams">Exploration of the
Unconscious and Dreams</h3>
<ul>
<li>Surrealism aimed to reveal the hidden world of the unconscious
mind-the part of our brain that holds dreams, desires, and fears we are
not always aware of</li>
<li>Artists used techniques like automatism (creating art without
conscious control) to let their imagination flow freely and bring
strange, dreamlike images to life</li>
<li>This made their art feel mysterious, surprising, and sometimes
unsettling</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unexpected-juxtapositions-and-symbolism">Unexpected
Juxtapositions and Symbolism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Surrealist works often combine unrelated objects or ideas in bizarre
or surprising ways, creating strange scenes that challenge logic and
everyday reality</li>
<li>These unexpected combinations force viewers to question what they
see and think beyond normal rules, often using symbols to explore themes
like desire, fear, identity, and the irrational</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rebellion-against-rationalism-and-tradition">Rebellion Against
Rationalism and Tradition</h3>
<ul>
<li>Surrealism reacted against the strict rules of traditional art and
the rational thinking that many believed had led to the horrors of World
War I</li>
<li>Instead, it celebrated imagination, chance, and the irrational,
seeking to unite dream and reality into a “surreality” or a new kind of
absolute reality that includes both conscious and unconscious
experience</li>
