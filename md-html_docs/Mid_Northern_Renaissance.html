<h3 id="detailed-realism-symbolism">Detailed Realism &amp; Symbolism</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Artists such as Hieronymus Bosch and Gerard David created paintings with astonishing detail and realism.</li>
  <li>They used oil paints to achieve glowing colours and incredibly fine textures that made every material – from skin to metal – look convincing.</li>
  <li>Their works are packed with symbolism, where objects, animals, and gestures carry hidden religious or moral meanings.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="moral-storytelling">Moral &amp; Religious Storytelling</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Northern artists told traditional religious stories in new, imaginative, and sometimes unsettling ways.</li>
  <li>Bosch’s fantastical paintings, filled with unusual creatures and dramatic scenes, aimed to make viewers reflect on sin, temptation, and the consequences of wrong choices.</li>
  <li>Their works encouraged viewers to think about morality, life, death, and the fate of the soul.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical-innovation">Innovation in Technique &amp; Perspective</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Artists developed advanced techniques for depicting space and light, using linear perspective and dramatic shadows.</li>
  <li>Landscapes and everyday settings provided realistic backgrounds for religious and moral stories.</li>
