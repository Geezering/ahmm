<h1 id="mannerism">Mannerism (1550–1600)</h1>
<p>
  Mannerism followed the High Renaissance, known for its elegance, complexity, and emotional intensity. Artists deliberately moved away from naturalism to create sophisticated, sometimes strange images designed for educated audiences.
</p>

<h2 id="summary-points">Three Key Points</h2>

<h3 id="artificiality-elegance-distortion">Artificiality, Elegance &amp; Distortion</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Artists like Pontormo, Bronzino, and Parmigianino rejected the balance and harmony of the High Renaissance.</li>
  <li>Their work is intentionally artificial, with elongated bodies, unusual poses, and sophisticated, almost mannered detail.</li>
  <li>Mannerist art is often stylish and decorative—displaying skill rather than depicting real life.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="complex-composition-space">Complex Composition &amp; Unusual Space</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mannerist paintings have crowded or strangely empty spaces, and compositions can feel tense or unbalanced.</li>
  <li>Backgrounds may have odd or impossible perspectives, creating a sense of instability.</li>
  <li>Unusual colour combinations and dramatic lighting add to the intensity and theatrical effect.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sophistication-symbolism">Intellectual Sophistication &amp; Symbolism</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mannerist artists filled their work with clever references to mythology, classical art, and philosophy.</li>
  <li>Puzzle-like scenes invite viewers to look for hidden meanings and enjoy the mystery, rather than just following a simple story.</li>
  <li>This complexity appealed to wealthy and educated patrons who valued intellectual challenge and elegance.</li>
