<h2 id="key-themes">Key Themes and Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="mixing-styles-irony-playfulness">Mixing Styles, Irony, and Playfulness</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Postmodern artists blend different styles, times, and cultural references with humour and irony.</li>
  <li>They mix “high” art (painting, sculpture) and “low” culture (advertising, comics, TV), often using parody and pastiche to mimic or remix existing works.</li>
  <li>This approach questions seriousness and originality, encouraging playfulness and self-awareness in art.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="questioning-truth-originality">Questioning Truth, Meaning, and Originality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Postmodernism is sceptical about art revealing universal truths or stable meanings.</li>
  <li>Artists often use appropriation (borrowing other images) and repetition to show that all art is, in some way, a remix of past #sources.</li>
  <li>Meaning is seen as changeable and dependent on context and interpretation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="complexity-contradiction-consumerism">Complexity, Contradiction, and Consumerism</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Postmodern art is often layered and contradictory, reflecting the complexities of modern life.</li>
  <li>Artists explore identity, gender, mass media, politics, and consumer culture, frequently using new technologies: video, installation, and performance.</li>
