<h2 id="key-themes-ideas-and-artistic-aspects">Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects</h2>

<h3 id="extreme-simplicity-and-geometric-forms">Extreme Simplicity and Geometric Forms</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Minimalist artists used basic shapes, like squares, rectangles, and straight lines, avoiding extra decoration or detail.</li>
  <li>Works often feature repeated patterns, hard edges, and very limited colours—sometimes just black, white, or primaries.</li>
  <li>The aim was to reduce art to its simplest elements: to make art that is just itself, not a picture or symbol of something else.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="focus-on-materials-and-objectivity">Focus on Materials and Objectivity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Minimalism treats the artwork as a physical object, not a story or a symbol.</li>
  <li>Artists used industrial materials (steel, aluminium, fluorescent lights) and wanted the work to look machine-made, not hand-crafted.</li>
  <li>Personal expression and emotion were removed; the material, colour, and form speak for themselves (“What you see is what you see”—Frank Stella).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="direct-visual-experience-for-the-viewer">Direct Visual Experience for the Viewer</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Minimalism is about experiencing the artwork in the here and now—there is no hidden meaning or narrative.</li>
  <li>It asks viewers to focus on shapes, colours, and the way the artwork relates to space.</li>
  <li>The art is self-referential; it is about itself and the viewer’s immediate response to it.</li>
</ul>

</span>
<p>Donald Judd's Untitled, 1967 is emblematic of his mature style, and though Judd refuted the term Minimalism, his work came to represent the ideas and artwork that Minimalism generated. Untitled is created by ten stainless steel and Plexiglas units, hung equidistant from each other between the floor and ceiling.</p> 
<p>Judd once wrote, “The main virtue of geometric shapes is that they aren't organic, as all art otherwise is.” Untitled is made of rectangular metal boxes: a simple geometric form the artist favored because he felt it carried no symbolic meaning. The spaces between the units are equal to each unit's height.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Leading Minimalist</b>, famous for precise, industrially fabricated sculptures—simple, repeated geometric forms.</li>
  <li><b>Rejected narrative</b>; focused on the object’s presence and its relationship to real (gallery) space.</li>
  <li><b>Influenced the direction</b> of contemporary sculpture and installation art.</li>

<p>"Untitled" is a common title used by Robert Ryman for many of his paintings, reflecting his focus on the physical properties of paint and the act of painting itself, rather than representation or narrative. His "Untitled" works, often in white or off-white, explore the relationship between the support (canvas, board, etc.), the paint, and the viewer's perception.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Famous for almost all-white paintings investigating the qualities of paint and surface.</li>
  <li>Focussed on painting as a process: texture, light, and support mattered more than image.</li>
  <li>One of the most important Minimalist painters for radical reduction to pure painterly elements.</li>

  <span class="title">Untitled (to You Heidegger)</span>
  <span class="year">1973</span>
</span>
<p><b>Description of the piece installed at London's Serpentine gallery:</b></p>
<p>The installation of Untitled (to you, Heidegger, with admiration and affection) (1973) playfully introduces Flavin's art to the natural world, its luminous green grids echoed in the verdant squares of grass visible through the Serpentine's windows. Stretching across the gallery space like a snaking pack of cards, the fluorescent fittings create a low wall between the viewer and the windowpanes.</p>
<p>Stay in the room for a few moments and the parkland beyond the glass turns pink. Behind its double barrier, nature looks as synthetic as bubble gum, while the interior hovers uneasily between an emerald forest and the cartoonish laboratory of an evil scientist. Of course, the pink grass is a trick of the light, an afterglow of complementary colour following the dominant neon green. But, twinned with this bank of windows, the seeping illuminations of Untitled suggest larger tensions between natural and manufactured environments.</p>
<p>A gallery marooned in Kensington Park (a swatch of greenery hemmed in by choked west London streets), the Serpentine has always riffed on the theme of art versus nature. By setting Flavin's strip-lights against a more complex backdrop than their usual four white walls, the curators have drawn something unexpected from an artist overgrown with brambly 1970s theory.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pioneered sculptural installations using standard fluorescent tubes in different colours.</li>
  <li>Works focus on repetition, seriality, and how light changes perception of space.</li>
  <li>Invited viewers to experience minimalist art as light and architecture combine.</li>

</p>
<p>
Morris' first set of four mirror boxes was made in 1965 for his exhibition at the Green Gallery, New York, in February 1965, but he subsequently destroyed it because the boxes were made of perspex and the mirroring would not stick on. According to the Castelli records, these boxes were 21in (53.5cm) cubes, which the artist says tallies with his recollections. (It also seems to be confirmed by a photograph showing them in the Green Gallery installation). However Annette Michelson, loc. cit., states that they were 3ft (91.5cm) cubes and were set 6ft (183cm) apart, while in the Whitney catalogue they are reproduced as 28in (71cm) cubes. Morris' retrospective exhibition at Washington and Detroit in 1969-70 (21) included a 'current reconstruction, original damaged' with perspex mirrors on wood, 3 x 3 x 3ft (91.5 x 91.5 x 91.5cm), but this was destroyed at the end of the exhibition.
</p>
<p>
The artist stated (letter of 27 June 1974) that he believes he has made three or four versions, most probably only three as this is his usual limit. The Tate's version was first fabricated in London in 1971 for his exhibition at the Tate Gallery, and then remade in 1976, with his permission, in more permanent materials (3mm Sandersilver Mirror S.Q. over Aeroweb F-Board cubes). A further version the same size in highly polished stainless steel was made in 1974 for the Sonnabend Gallery, New York, the advantage of stainless steel being that it does not break. The Castelli records also list a third version, said to have been made for the Galleria Sperone in Turin, but this has never been fabricated and the artist says he does not plan to make any more.
</p>
<p>
He added in the same letter: 'Originally the space between the boxes was equal to the combined volume of the 4 boxes, but I haven't followed that rule recently and generally place them more with regard to the space of the room - always maintaining enough room - some 5 or 6 feet at minimum - between them for walking.'

  <li><b>Personal expression and hidden meanings were removed</b>—the art was about direct, immediate visual experience and objectivity.</li>

<h2 id="glossary-for-students">Glossary for Students</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Geometric:</strong> Made of regular shapes like squares, rectangles, and straight lines</li>
