<h2 id="key-themes-ideas-and-artistic-aspects">Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects</h2>

<h3 id="extreme-simplicity-and-geometric-forms">Extreme Simplicity and Geometric Forms</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Minimalist artists used basic shapes, like squares, rectangles, and straight lines, avoiding extra decoration or detail.</li>
  <li>Works often feature repeated patterns, hard edges, and very limited colours—sometimes just black, white, or primaries.</li>
  <li>The aim was to reduce art to its simplest elements: to make art that is just itself, not a picture or symbol of something else.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="focus-on-materials-and-objectivity">Focus on Materials and Objectivity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Minimalism treats the artwork as a physical object, not a story or a symbol.</li>
  <li>Artists used industrial materials (steel, aluminium, fluorescent lights) and wanted the work to look machine-made, not hand-crafted.</li>
  <li>Personal expression and emotion were removed; the material, colour, and form speak for themselves (“What you see is what you see”—Frank Stella).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="direct-visual-experience-for-the-viewer">Direct Visual Experience for the Viewer</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Minimalism is about experiencing the artwork in the here and now—there is no hidden meaning or narrative.</li>
  <li>It asks viewers to focus on shapes, colours, and the way the artwork relates to space.</li>
  <li>The art is self-referential; it is about itself and the viewer’s immediate response to it.</li>
</ul>
