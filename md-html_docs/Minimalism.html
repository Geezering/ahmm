Context</h1>
<h2 id="key-themes-ideas-and-artistic-aspects">Key Themes, Ideas, and
Artistic Aspects</h2>
<h3 id="extreme-simplicity-and-geometric-forms">Extreme Simplicity and
Geometric Forms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minimalist artists used very simple shapes-like squares, rectangles,
and straight lines-and avoided decoration or unnecessary detail</li>
<li>Their work often features repeated patterns, hard edges, and a
limited range of colours, sometimes just black, white, or primary
colours</li>
<li>The aim was to strip art down to its most basic elements, so that
what you see is just the object itself, not a picture of something
else</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="focus-on-materials-and-objectivity">Focus on Materials and
Objectivity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minimalism is about the artwork as a physical object, not a symbol
or a story</li>
<li>Artists used industrial materials such as steel, aluminium, and
fluorescent lights, and wanted their art to look as if it could have
been made by a machine, not by hand</li>
<li>They removed personal expression, emotion, and narrative, letting
the material and form speak for themselves</li>
<li>As Frank Stella said, “What you see is what you see”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="direct-visual-experience-for-the-viewer">Direct Visual
Experience for the Viewer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minimalist art is designed to be experienced in the here and
now</li>
<li>There’s no hidden meaning or message-the viewer is meant to respond
directly to the artwork’s shape, colour, and space</li>
<li>The art doesn’t refer to anything outside itself; it’s all about the
immediate, physical experience of looking at it</li>

<h2 id="key-artists">Key Artists:</h2>
<h3 id="josef-albers">Josef Albers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Albers was a pivotal figure in abstract art and colour theory, best
known for his “Homage to the Square” series, where he systematically
explored the optical effects of colour through nested geometric
forms</li>
<li>His teaching at the Bauhaus, Black Mountain College, and Yale, along
with his influential book <em>Interaction of Color</em>, profoundly
shaped postwar art education and the development of Colour Field
painting and Minimalism</li>
<li>Albers’s disciplined approach emphasised perception,
experimentation, and the relativity of colour, making him a foundational
theorist and practitioner in twentieth-century abstraction</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="donald-judd">Donald Judd</h3>
<ul>
<li>Judd was a leading exponent of Minimalism, known for his precise,
industrially fabricated sculptures and installations composed of simple,
repeated geometric forms</li>
<li>He rejected illusionism and narrative, focusing instead on the
object’s physical presence and its relationship to space</li>
<li>Judd’s work emphasised clarity, order, and the autonomy of art,
influencing the direction of contemporary sculpture and
installation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="robert-mangold">Robert Mangold</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mangold is recognised for his minimalist paintings featuring large,
shaped canvases, subtle colour fields, and hand-drawn geometric
lines</li>
<li>His work explores the interplay between form, proportion, and
surface, often challenging the conventions of the rectangular
canvas</li>
<li>Mangold’s restrained aesthetic and focus on visual perception align
him closely with Minimalist and post-painterly abstraction</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="agnes-martin">Agnes Martin</h3>
<ul>
<li>Martin’s art is characterised by delicate grids, subtle stripes, and
restrained palettes, creating meditative compositions that evoke
tranquillity and introspection</li>
<li>She sought to express abstract concepts such as innocence,
happiness, and perfection through repetition and simplicity</li>
<li>Martin’s minimalist approach and spiritual sensibility made her a
key figure in both Minimalism and Abstract Expressionism</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="robert-ryman">Robert Ryman</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ryman is best known for his nearly all-white paintings, which
investigate the material qualities of paint, surface, and support</li>
<li>His work focuses on the act of painting itself, emphasising process,
texture, and the interaction of light with the painted surface</li>
<li>Ryman’s radical reduction of imagery to pure painterly experience
places him among the most important Minimalist painters</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dan-flavin">Dan Flavin</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flavin pioneered the use of commercially available fluorescent light
tubes to create sculptural installations that transform architectural
spaces with coloured light</li>
<li>His minimalist works emphasise repetition, seriality, and the
ephemeral qualities of light and colour</li>
<li>Flavin’s art invites viewers to experience space and perception in
new ways, making him a central figure in light-based Minimalism</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="robert-morris">Robert Morris</h3>
<ul>
<li>Morris was a key theorist and practitioner of Minimalism, creating
large-scale, modular sculptures that emphasise simplicity, repetition,
and viewer interaction</li>
<li>He also explored performance, process art, and conceptual art,
broadening the scope of Minimalist practice</li>
<li>Morris’s writings and installations challenged traditional
boundaries between art and environment</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="carl-andre">Carl Andre</h3>
<ul>
<li>Andre is renowned for his floor-based sculptures made from
industrial materials such as bricks, metal plates, and timber, arranged
in simple, grid-like patterns</li>
<li>His work invites direct physical engagement, focusing on material
presence and spatial relationships</li>
<li>Andre’s radical approach to sculpture redefined the role of the
viewer and the meaning of artistic authorship</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="frank-stella">Frank Stella</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stella’s early minimalist paintings, such as the “Black Paintings,”
featured geometric patterns and shaped canvases that rejected
illusionism and emphasised the flatness of the picture plane</li>
<li>He later expanded into colourful, three-dimensional reliefs and
sculptures, maintaining a focus on repetition, symmetry, and
materiality</li>
<li>Stella’s mantra, “What you see is what you see,” encapsulates his
commitment to non-representational, self-referential art</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sol-lewitt">Sol LeWitt</h3>
<ul>
<li>LeWitt was a pioneer of Conceptual and Minimal art, known for his
wall drawings and sculptures based on systematic instructions and
geometric forms</li>
<li>He emphasised the idea behind the artwork over its execution, often
delegating the realisation of his works to others</li>
<li>LeWitt’s approach foregrounded seriality, logic, and the
dematerialisation of the art object</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ellsworth-kelly">Ellsworth Kelly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kelly’s art is defined by bold, hard-edged shapes, vibrant colour
fields, and the use of shaped canvases to explore the relationship
between form and space</li>
<li>He rejected illusion and gesture, focusing on the direct visual
impact of colour and geometry</li>
<li>Kelly’s work bridges Colour Field painting and Minimalism,
influencing generations of abstract artists</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="anne-truitt">Anne Truitt</h3>
<ul>
<li>Truitt was a pioneering minimalist sculptor, known for her
hand-painted, columnar wooden sculptures in subtle, luminous
colours</li>
<li>Her work combines geometric simplicity with emotional resonance,
reflecting on memory, place, and perception</li>
<li>Truitt’s practice emphasises the importance of process and the
personal dimension within Minimalist aesthetics</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="richard-serra">Richard Serra</h3>
<ul>
<li>Serra is celebrated for his monumental steel sculptures that engage
viewers physically and spatially, often altering perceptions of balance,
movement, and enclosure</li>
<li>His minimalist works are site-specific, focusing on the relationship
between material, scale, and environment</li>
<li>Serra’s art challenges viewers to navigate and experience space,
making him a leading figure in contemporary sculpture</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="three-short-points-for-students">Three Short Points for
Students</h1>
<ul>
<li>Minimalist artists made art with simple geometric shapes, industrial
materials, and little or no decoration, focusing on the object itself
rather than telling a story or showing emotion</li>
<li>They removed personal expression and wanted their art to be about
pure visual experience-what you see is what you get, with no hidden
meanings</li>
<li>The movement was a reaction against earlier, more emotional art, and
aimed to create a direct, immediate impact through simplicity,
repetition, and precision</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="glossary-for-students">Glossary for Students:</h1>
