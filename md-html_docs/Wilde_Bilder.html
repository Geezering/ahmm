Style</h3>

its bold, expressive use of colour and brushwork</li>

before, aiming to show raw emotion and personal experience on the
canvas</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="figurative-focus-and-urban-life">Figurative Focus and Urban
Life</h3>

<li>Instead of abstract shapes, Wilde Bilder artists focused on

(feeling alone in a crowd) of urban life, especially in Berlin during
the 1980s</li>
