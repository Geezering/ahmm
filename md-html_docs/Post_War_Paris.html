<h3 id="existentialism-and-the-search-for-meaning">Existentialism and the Search for Meaning</h3>
<ul>
  <li>After World War II, many Parisian artists were strongly influenced by existentialist philosophy, exploring the search for meaning and authenticity in a world changed by suffering and upheaval.</li>
  <li>Their art often expressed themes of anxiety, personal freedom, and the cultural and personal challenge of rebuilding.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="abstract-and-lyrical-painting">Abstract and Lyrical Painting</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Artists moved away from realistic depiction towards abstraction and “lyrical abstraction”—a style marked by expressive brushwork, spontaneous gesture, and vibrant colour.</li>
  <li>Painters such as Pierre Soulages and Nicolas de Staël experimented with new ways to convey emotion, balancing figuration (recognisable images) with pure abstraction.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="art-brut-and-new-materials">Art Brut and New Materials</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Jean Dubuffet pioneered “Art Brut” (“raw art”), championing the creativity of outsiders and using rough textures and unconventional materials.</li>

<p>"Grand Messager" is a work by French artist Jean Dubuffet, created in 1961. It is part of his larger body of work exploring "art brut" or "outsider art," which emphasizes raw, uninhibited expression. "Grand Messager" is rendered in vivid colors and larger-than-life dimensions, drawing the viewer into a unique topography of characters and forms. The piece is a testament to Dubuffet's revolutionary approach to art, his interest in the tactile possibilities of materials, and his fascination with the human form. </p>

  <li>French painter and sculptor; founder of Art Brut (“raw art”), championing outsider creativity over academic tradition.</li>
  <li>Used unconventional materials such as tar, gravel, sand, and found objects to create rough, textured works.</li>

<p>In 1963, Hans Hartung was actively creating gestural, abstract paintings that were part of the Art Informel movement. He was known for his expressive and dynamic compositions, often using bold, calligraphic brushstrokes and experimenting with techniques like rakes and olive branches. Some of his works from this period are titled "P1963 - 8" and "T 1963-K17". Hartung's work was gaining recognition internationally, with exhibitions in major cities like New York, Paris, and London. </p>
<ul>
  <li>German-French painter, pioneer of gestural abstraction (“Tachisme”).</li>
  <li>Created energetic, calligraphic works using spontaneous marks and unconventional tools.</li>
  <li>Influenced Art Informel and Abstract Expressionism in Europe.</li>

<p>In 1943, while producing his Otages (Hostages) series, Jean Fautrier hid from the Gestapo in a psychiatric asylum outside Paris. At night he heard gunfire in the surrounding woods as Nazi authorities massacred French civilians. Given this painting’s lurid title, Dépouille, meaning “skin” or “human remains,” and the horrific context of the series to which it belongs, viewers might be surprised to encounter a nebulous abstract form and an appealing, frothy palette. However, what this signals is a conundrum: how should a visual artist address Nazi atrocities without sensationalizing them? Fautrier’s strategy was to indicate violence in his handling of materials, rather than through traditional figurative means. He created Dépouille by smearing a stuccolike white paste across a layered paper surface, then sprinkling pastel powders on the central shape, loosely delineated in blue brushstrokes. It is the painting’s rough, scored, cracked matter above all that portrays the brutalization of bodies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>French painter and sculptor associated with Art Informel and Tachisme, known for his focus on texture and psychological depth.</li>
  <li>His “Hostages” series, created during WWII, used thick layers of paint to evoke suffering and trauma.</li>
