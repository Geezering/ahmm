<h3 id="jean-dubuffet">Jean Dubuffet</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dubuffet</strong> was a French painter, sculptor, and
printmaker best known for founding the art brut (“raw art”) movement,
which championed the creativity of outsiders, including children and the
mentally ill, over academic and cultural norms</li>
<li>Rejecting traditional standards of beauty, he sought authenticity
and immediacy in art, often using unconventional materials like tar,
gravel, sand, and found objects to create rough, textured surfaces and
ideographic imagery</li>
<li>Dubuffet’s philosophy and techniques were influential in postwar
modernism, and his prolific experimentation across painting, sculpture,
and even architecture positioned him as a groundbreaking figure in
20th-century art</li>
<li>His work and writings, including the lecture “Anticultural
Positions,” inspired later generations to challenge established cultural
values and to seek new forms of expression rooted in everyday life and
instinct</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pierre-soulages">Pierre Soulages</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soulages</strong> was a celebrated French abstract painter,
renowned for his lifelong exploration of black as both colour and light,
a concept he termed “noir-lumière” or “outrenoir” (“beyond black”)</li>
<li>His signature works feature thick, gestural brushstrokes and
textured surfaces that reflect and absorb light, creating dynamic visual
effects</li>
<li>Soulages’s radical minimalism, focus on materiality, and meditative
approach made him one of the most influential European painters of the
late 20th and early 21st centuries</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nicolas-de-staël">Nicolas de Staël</h3>

<li><strong>De Staël</strong> was a Russian-born French painter known
for his luminous, abstract landscapes and still lifes, characterised by
thick impasto and bold, block-like forms</li>
<li>He bridged figuration and abstraction, using vibrant colour and
dynamic composition to evoke atmosphere and emotion</li>
<li>De Staël’s expressive, tactile surfaces and poetic sensibility had a
significant impact on postwar European painting before his untimely
death at age 41</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hans-hartung">Hans Hartung</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hartung</strong> was a German-French painter and a pioneer
of European gestural abstraction, or “Tachisme.”</li>

unconventional tools, to create dynamic, energetic compositions that
emphasise movement and emotion</li>
<li>Hartung’s innovative techniques and expressive mark-making
influenced the development of Art Informel and abstract expressionism in
Europe</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jean-fautrier">Jean Fautrier</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fautrier</strong> was a French painter and sculptor
associated with Art Informel and Tachisme, known for his textured,
abstract works and emotionally charged imagery</li>
<li>His “Hostages” series, created during World War II, used thick
layers of paint and rough surfaces to evoke suffering and trauma</li>
<li>Fautrier’s focus on materiality, texture, and psychological depth
made him a key figure in postwar European art</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bram-van-velde">Bram van Velde</h3>

<li><strong>Van Velde</strong> was a Dutch painter linked to the School
of Paris and Abstract Expressionism, noted for his sombre palettes,

<li>His paintings often feature abstracted, biomorphic shapes and a
restrained use of colour, conveying a sense of melancholy and
introspection</li>

Samuel Beckett, for its poetic ambiguity and emotional resonance</li>

co-founder of Cubism</li>
<li>His prolific career encompassed numerous styles, from the Blue and
Rose periods to Cubism, Neoclassicism, Surrealism, and beyond</li>
<li>Picasso’s innovations in form, perspective, and symbolism
revolutionised modern art, and his masterpieces, such as “Les
Demoiselles d’Avignon” and “Guernica,” are icons of Western art
history</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="henri-matisse">Henri Matisse</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Matisse</strong> was a French painter, draughtsman, and
sculptor, celebrated for his use of vibrant colour, fluid line, and
decorative pattern</li>
<li>A leader of Fauvism, he created exuberant, expressive works that
prioritised colour as a means of conveying emotion and structure</li>

compositions cemented his reputation as a master of modern art and a
rival to Picasso</li>
