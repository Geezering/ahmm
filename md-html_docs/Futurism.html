<h2 id="core-ideas">Core Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="speed-technology-modern-life">Celebration of Speed, Technology, and Modern Life</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Futurist artists like <strong>Filippo Tommaso Marinetti</strong>, <strong>Umberto Boccioni</strong>, <strong>Carlo Carrà</strong>, <strong>Gino Severini</strong>, and <strong>Giacomo Balla</strong> focused on the energy, movement, and dynamism of the modern world.</li>
  <li>They celebrated machines, cars, trains, aeroplanes, and fast-paced city life, aiming to capture the excitement and power of new technologies in their art.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rejection-of-past">Rejection of the Past and Emphasis on Change</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Futurists wanted a complete break from tradition—calling museums "cemeteries" and demanding the destruction of old art to make way for the new.</li>
  <li>Their manifestos glorified originality, violence, and revolution, seeing war as a way to sweep away outdated ideas and celebrate the future.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="movement-techniques">Innovative Artistic Techniques for Movement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To show speed and motion, Futurists used blurring, repetition, and “lines of force”—strong visual lines showing movement, borrowed from Cubism.</li>
  <li>Their art often looks fragmented and vibrant, with overlapping forms and bright colours that suggest energy in action.</li>
  <li>They experimented across painting, sculpture, literature, music, and even architecture to share their vision of a dynamic world.</li>
</ul>
