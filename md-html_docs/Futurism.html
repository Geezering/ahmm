(1909–1918): Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects</h1>
<h1 id="three-short-points">Three Short Points</h1>
<h2 id="celebration-of-speed-technology-and-modern-life">Celebration of
Speed, Technology, and Modern Life</h2>
<ul>
<li>Futurist artists like Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni,
Carlo Carrà, Gino Severini, and Giacomo Balla focused on the energy,
movement, and dynamism of the modern world</li>
<li>They were fascinated by machines, cars, trains, aeroplanes, and the
fast pace of urban life, aiming to capture the excitement and power of
new technology in their art</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rejection-of-the-past-and-emphasis-on-change">Rejection of the
Past and Emphasis on Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Futurists wanted to break completely with tradition-they
famously declared that museums were like cemeteries and called for the
destruction of old art to make way for the new</li>
<li>Their manifestos demanded originality, violence, and revolution,
glorifying war and upheaval as ways to sweep aside outdated ideas and
celebrate the future</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="innovative-artistic-techniques-to-show-movement">Innovative
Artistic Techniques to Show Movement</h2>
<ul>
<li>To express speed and motion, Futurist artists used techniques such
as blurring, repetition, and “lines of force” (strong lines showing
direction and energy, borrowed from Cubism)</li>
<li>Their works often appear fragmented, with bright colours and
overlapping forms that suggest things are moving or vibrating</li>
<li>They worked across painting, sculpture, literature, music, and even
architecture to spread their vision of a dynamic, ever-changing
world</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="artists-and-period--period-19091918">## ## Artists and Period-
Period: 1909–1918</h2>
<h1 id="key-artists">Key Artists:</h1>
<h3 id="filippo-tommaso-marinetti">Filippo Tommaso Marinetti</h3>
<ul>
<li>Marinetti was the founder and chief theorist of Futurism, writing
the “Futurist Manifesto” in 1909, which called for the rejection of
tradition and the celebration of speed, technology, and modernity</li>
<li>He promoted art that glorified violence, dynamism, and the energy of
the machine age, seeing war as a means of societal renewal</li>
<li>Marinetti’s radical ideas and manifestos inspired and united the
Futurist artists, shaping the movement’s aggressive, avant-garde
spirit</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="umberto-boccioni">Umberto Boccioni</h3>
<ul>
<li>Boccioni was a leading Futurist painter and sculptor, known for
capturing movement, energy, and the dynamism of modern life in both two
and three dimensions</li>
<li>His works, such as “Unique Forms of Continuity in Space,” broke down
solid forms to convey speed and fluidity, reflecting the influence of
Cubism but with a focus on motion</li>
<li>Boccioni’s theoretical writings and innovative art helped define
Futurism’s visual language and its emphasis on the transformation of
reality through technology</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="carlo-carrà">Carlo Carrà</h3>
<ul>
<li>Carrà was a key figure in the Futurist movement, renowned for using
bold colours, fragmented forms, and dynamic compositions to express the
chaos and energy of contemporary urban life</li>
<li>He sought to convey “dynamic simultaneity,” representing multiple
states of mind and movement within a single image, as seen in works like
“The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli”</li>
<li>Carrà’s art and manifestos contributed to Futurism’s focus on
modernity, revolution, and the depiction of motion, while later in his
career he played a role in the development of Metaphysical painting</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gino-severini">Gino Severini</h3>
<ul>
<li>Severini’s Futurist paintings often depicted scenes of dance,
nightlife, and urban excitement, using rhythmic lines and vibrant
colours to evoke movement and energy</li>
<li>He was instrumental in introducing Futurism to the Parisian
avant-garde and integrating elements of Cubism and Divisionism into the
movement</li>
<li>Severini’s work explored the relationship between art, music, and
the mechanised rhythms of modern life, contributing to the international
reach of Futurism</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="giacomo-balla">Giacomo Balla</h3>
<ul>
<li>Balla was a pioneer in expressing speed, light, and motion through
abstract forms, often using repeated lines and fragmented shapes to
suggest movement</li>
<li>His works, such as “Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash,” exemplify the
Futurist fascination with capturing fleeting moments and the mechanics
of motion</li>
<li>Balla’s experiments with colour, form, and kinetic art made him a
central figure in both the theoretical and practical development of
Futurism</li>
</ul>
