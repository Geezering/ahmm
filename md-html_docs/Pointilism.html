<h2 id="key-ideas">Key Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="painting-with-dots">Painting with Dots of Colour</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pointillism is a technique where artists use tiny, separate dots of pure, unmixed colour to create an image.</li>
  <li>Rather than mixing pigments on a palette, artists place small dots side by side, allowing the viewer’s eye to blend the colours from a distance.</li>
  <li>This creates a vibrant, shimmering effect and relies on the science of optics—how we see and process colour.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="scientific-optics">Science and Optical Blending</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pointillists were fascinated by colour theory and the science of how we perceive light and shade.</li>
  <li>They applied paint precisely, using careful planning so the image blends and glows when seen from afar.</li>
  <li>This technique is more systematic and scientific than Impressionism, aiming for harmony and brilliance by letting your eyes do the mixing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="patience-new-vision">Patience and New Ways of Seeing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pointillism requires patience and precision—every dot matters.</li>
  <li>The focus was on the painting method rather than the subject matter itself.</li>
  <li>The technique encourages viewers to step back and see the whole picture, changing how people think about painting and perception.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<h3 id="locations">Main Locations</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Paris</strong>, France (the movement's centre)</li>
  <li><strong>Belgium</strong>, Holland, and eventually other European cities</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="previous-movements">Relevant Previous Art Movements</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Impressionism</strong> – Used dabs of paint for light, but Pointillism went further with dots and scientific planning.</li>
  <li><strong>Neo-Impressionism</strong> – Pointillism is a branch of this movement.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="culture-politics">Cultural and Political Background</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Late 19th-century Europe:</strong> an era of scientific discovery, industrial growth, and fascination with progress and technology.</li>
  <li>Artists were inspired by breakthroughs in science, especially optics (the study of light and vision).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="inventions-tech">Inventions and Technology</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Advances in colour chemistry and new paint pigments</li>
  <li>Early photography and scientific research on vision</li>
  <li>The pixel effect in Pointillism is similar to how digital screens display images, using many tiny coloured dots.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fashion">Fashion</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Men:</strong> Three-piece suits, bowler hats, moustaches</li>
  <li><strong>Women:</strong> High-necked blouses, long skirts, corsets, and decorative hats</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="period">Period</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1880–1890 (core years, though some continued the technique after)</li>

<ul>
  <li>French painter who invented Pointillism (also known as Divisionism).</li>
  <li>Built images from countless dots of unmixed colour, which visually blend when seen from a distance.</li>
  <li><em>A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte</em> is a famous example and a manifesto for the style.</li>
  <li>Influenced by scientific theories about colour and vision; his innovations paved the way for Neo-Impressionism.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Close collaborator of Seurat and the movement's leader after Seurat's death.</li>
  <li>Produced vibrant landscapes, seascapes, and urban views using dots and strokes of colour.</li>
  <li>Promoted Pointillism across Europe through his writing and leadership in the Société des Artistes Indépendants.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Impressionist elder who briefly adopted Pointillism in the 1880s after meeting Seurat and Signac.</li>
  <li>Applied the technique to landscapes and rural scenes, experimenting with optical colour mixing.</li>
  <li>This phase contributed to the wider acceptance of Neo-Impressionism.</li>
