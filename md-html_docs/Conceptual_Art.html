<h1 id="conceptual-art">Conceptual Art</h1>

<h2 id="about">Overview</h2>
<p>
  Conceptual Art is an art movement where the main focus is on the idea or concept behind the work, rather than the traditional emphasis on how it looks or the materials used. In this movement, ideas are considered artworks in their own right, and the finished object is often less important than the thinking and process behind it. This challenged the usual way art was made, shared, and valued.

<h2 id="student-summary">In Simple Terms for Students</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Conceptual Art is about the idea—what matters is the concept, not whether the artwork is beautiful or what materials are used.</li>
  <li>Artists often use ordinary things, words, or actions to communicate their message, and sometimes anyone can remake the art by following instructions.</li>
  <li>The most important thing is thinking about what art is, how it’s made, and who gets to decide.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="glossary">Glossary for Students</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Conceptual Art:</strong> The idea matters more than the finished object.</li>
  <li><strong>Social sculpture:</strong> Joseph Beuys’s idea—society itself can be shaped by creative acts, not just objects.</li>
  <li><strong>Institutional critique:</strong> Art that shows or questions the hidden rules or power structures in museums, galleries, or society.</li>
  <li><strong>Ephemeral:</strong> Artworks designed to last only a short time or not at all.</li>
