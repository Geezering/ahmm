<h2 id="geometric-abstraction-as-social-critique">Geometric Abstraction
as Social Critique</h2>
<ul>
<li>Neo Geo (short for Neo-Geometric Conceptualism) artists used sharp,
geometric shapes and abstract forms to comment on modern society</li>
<li>Their art critiqued consumerism (obsession with buying things),
commercialisation (turning everything into something to sell), and the
way technology and modern life shape how we experience the world</li>
<li>The geometry in their work often stands for the rigid, artificial
structures of city life and the feeling of isolation in a technological
age</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="irony-simulation-and-mass-production">Irony, Simulation, and
Mass Production</h2>
<ul>
<li>Neo Geo artists played with the idea of “simulation”-making art that
looks like something mass-produced or artificial, rather than unique or
handmade</li>
<li>They often borrowed images and styles from advertising, branding,
and industrial design, blurring the line between art and consumer
products</li>
<li>Their work sometimes mocks or questions whether art can truly
criticise consumer society when it is also bought and sold for high
prices</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ambiguity-and-self-reflection">Ambiguity and
Self-Reflection</h2>
<ul>
<li>The movement is known for being self-aware and sometimes
contradictory</li>
<li>While it critiques the superficiality and emptiness of consumer
culture, Neo Geo art itself became highly marketable and popular,
raising questions about whether it is truly critical or just part of the
system it comments on</li>
<li>Artists like Peter Halley and Jeff Koons used bright colours,
industrial materials, and familiar objects to make viewers think about
the meaning and value of art in a world full of copies and
simulations</li>
