<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
  Neo Geo (short for Neo-Geometric Conceptualism) is an art movement from the 1980s known for its sharp, geometric abstraction and critical stance on consumer society and technology. Artists used clean lines, industrial materials, and irony to explore themes of mass production, artificiality, and the blurred line between art and consumer goods.

<h2 id="themes">Key Themes and Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="geometric-abstraction">Geometric Abstraction as Social Critique</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Artists employed geometric shapes and abstract forms to reflect and question the rigid, artificial structures of city and modern life.</li>
  <li>Their art highlights the effects of consumerism, commercialisation, and technology on society, often depicting feelings of isolation or alienation.</li>
  <li>Geometry in their work stands for both order and emptiness in a rapidly changing, digital age.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="irony-simulation">Irony, Simulation, and Mass Production</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Neo Geo artists created work that intentionally looked synthetic or mass-produced, often blurring distinctions between fine art and branded commodities.</li>
  <li>They borrowed visual elements from advertising and industrial design, turning familiar images and logos into artworks.</li>
  <li>Work often played with the irony that art meant to critique consumerism could itself become fashionable and expensive.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ambiguity-reflection">Ambiguity and Self-Reflection</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Many Neo Geo pieces are self-aware, questioning whether true artistic critique is possible when art is itself part of the market.</li>
  <li>Artists used bright colours, shiny surfaces, and familiar motifs to attract viewers while also making them reflect on the meaning and value of art in a world of reproductions.</li>
  <li>This movement highlights the contradictions of postmodern life, where art can be both a critique and a product.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="glossary">Glossary for Students</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Geometric abstraction:</strong> Art using shapes like squares, circles, and grids, often without direct reference to real objects.</li>
  <li><strong>Simulation:</strong> Imitation or reproduction of something, often so well made that it’s hard to tell from the “real” thing.</li>
  <li><strong>Consumerism:</strong> Focus on buying and owning goods; a major theme in Neo Geo art.</li>
  <li><strong>Ambiguity:</strong> Something that can be understood in more than one way or doesn’t have a clear single meaning.</li>
