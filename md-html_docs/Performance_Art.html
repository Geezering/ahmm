<h3 id="the-body-as-art-and-direct-experience">The Body as Art and

<ul>

sculpture</li>
<li>Artists such as Marina Abramović and Joseph Beuys made their bodies
central to their work, exploring endurance, vulnerability, and
presence</li>

discomfort, or intense emotion</li>

postwar European art, renowned for his monochrome paintings—especially
those in his signature International Klein Blue (IKB)—and for his
radical innovations in performance art and conceptual approaches</li>

express immateriality and the infinite, and conceived the artwork as a
trace of communication between artist and world, rather than mere
representation</li>

(paintings made with models’ bodies), orchestrating immaterial art
sales, and treating his life as an artwork, influencing later

narratives in actions such as “How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare”

participation and healing made him a foundational figure in postwar
performance and conceptual art</li>
