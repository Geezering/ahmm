<h1 id="performance-art">Performance Art</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
 Performance Art is a form of contemporary art where the artist’s own body, actions, and presence become the artwork itself. Instead of creating permanent objects, performance artists focus on live, real-time experiences. Works are often engaging, challenging, and can be emotional or confrontational.

<h2 id="key-themes">Key Themes and Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="the-body-and-experience">The Body and Direct Experience</h3>
<ul>
 <li>The artist’s body is central—performance art is live, often unrepeatable, and uses actions instead of traditional art objects.</li>
 <li>Artists like Marina Abramović and Joseph Beuys explored endurance, presence, and vulnerability through their own bodies.</li>
 <li>Viewers experience the work in real time, making each performance unique and often intense or emotionally charged.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="breaking-boundaries">Breaking Boundaries and Audience Involvement</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Performance Art dissolves the boundary between art and daily life—performances may occur in galleries, on the street, or in unexpected places.</li>
 <li>Audience participation is often encouraged; works like Yoko Ono’s "Cut Piece" directly involve viewers in the art.</li>
 <li>Performances can be unpredictable, provocative, and may challenge or question social norms and the definition of art itself.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="social-political-messages">Social, Political, and Feminist Messages</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Artists use performance to address civil rights, feminism, war, and identity.</li>
 <li>Feminist artists such as Carolee Schneemann and Linda Mary Montano challenged stereotypes and re-examined the female body in art.</li>
 <li>Many performances respond to current events, aiming to provoke thought and, at times, inspire change.</li>
