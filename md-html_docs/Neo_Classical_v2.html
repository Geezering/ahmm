<ul>
<li>Neoclassical artists looked back to the art, architecture, and
stories of ancient Greece and Rome</li>
<li>They used classical themes, such as myths, heroic figures, and
historical events, aiming for harmony, simplicity, and ideal beauty</li>
<li>Their works often show balanced, symmetrical compositions and calm,
ordered scenes, avoiding the drama and decoration of the earlier Baroque
and Rococo styles</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="emphasis-on-line-clarity-and-moral-virtue">Emphasis on Line,
Clarity, and Moral Virtue</h2>
<ul>
<li>Neoclassical art is known for its clear outlines, smooth surfaces,
and restrained use of colour</li>
<li>Artists valued drawing (line) more than painting (colour) and
focused on precise, controlled technique</li>
<li>Many paintings and sculptures have a serious, unemotional (sometimes
called “austere”) look and often tell stories about duty, sacrifice, or
the importance of moral values</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="historical-accuracy-and-contemporary-relevance">Historical
Accuracy and Contemporary Relevance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Artists aimed to show costumes, settings, and details as accurately
as possible, based on archaeological discoveries and studies of
classical art</li>
<li>At the same time, they used ancient stories to comment on their own
times, especially during political events like the French
Revolution</li>
<li>For example, Jacques-Louis David’s paintings celebrated republican
values and heroism, linking ancient Rome to the struggles for liberty in
France</li>
