<h2 id="key-artists">Key Artists:</h2>
<h3 id="auguste-rodin">Auguste Rodin</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rodin is widely regarded as the founder of modern sculpture,
celebrated for his ability to model complex, emotionally charged
surfaces and for breaking away from the decorative, formulaic traditions
of his time</li>
<li>His most famous works, including <em>The Thinker</em>, <em>The
Kiss</em>, <em>The Burghers of Calais</em>, and <em>The Gates of
Hell</em>, are noted for their naturalism, expressive physicality, and
individual character</li>
<li>Rodin’s innovative approach influenced generations of sculptors, and
his legacy endures as one of the few sculptors known well beyond the
visual arts community</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="constantin-brâncuși">Constantin Brâncuși</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brâncuși was a Romanian-born sculptor who became a pioneer of
modernism, renowned for his radical simplification of form and pursuit
of the “essence” of subjects</li>
<li>His iconic works, such as <em>Bird in Space</em> and <em>The Endless
Column</em>, use smooth, abstract shapes to evoke spiritual and
universal qualities</li>
<li>Brâncuși’s influence is profound in both sculpture and design,
bridging traditional craftsmanship and avant-garde abstraction</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wassily-kandinsky">Wassily Kandinsky</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kandinsky was a Russian painter and theorist, considered one of the
founders of abstract art, who believed that colour and form could
directly express emotion and spirituality</li>
<li>His vibrant, non-representational compositions often evoke musical
analogies, aiming to create a “visual music” that transcends literal
subject matter</li>
<li>Kandinsky’s writings and teaching at the Bauhaus were instrumental
in shaping twentieth-century abstraction</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kurt-schwitters">Kurt Schwitters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Schwitters was a German artist associated with Dada and
Constructivism, best known for his “Merz” collages and assemblages made
from everyday materials</li>
<li>His work blurred the boundaries between painting, sculpture, and
poetry, and he created immersive environments such as the
“Merzbau.”</li>
<li>Schwitters’s inventive use of found objects and emphasis on creative
recycling influenced later developments in installation and conceptual
art</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="robert-delaunay">Robert Delaunay</h3>
<ul>
<li>Delaunay was a French painter who, with his wife Sonia, pioneered
Orphism—a movement focused on pure abstraction and vibrant colour
harmonies</li>
<li>His dynamic compositions, such as the <em>Windows</em> series,
explore the interplay of light, movement, and colour, often inspired by
modern urban life</li>
<li>Delaunay’s theories and practice helped expand the possibilities of
abstract painting in the early twentieth century</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sonia-terk-delaunay">Sonia Terk Delaunay</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sonia Delaunay was a key figure in the development of abstract art,

interdisciplinary approach</li>
<li>She worked across painting, textile design, fashion, and stage sets,
often collaborating with her husband Robert Delaunay on Orphist
projects</li>
<li>Sonia’s innovative designs and commitment to integrating art into
everyday life made her a major influence on modern visual culture</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="paul-klee">Paul Klee</h3>
<ul>
<li>Klee was a Swiss-German artist whose highly individual style
combined elements of abstraction, Surrealism, and Expressionism, often
inspired by music, poetry, and nature</li>
<li>His works are known for their playful use of line, colour, and
symbolism, as well as their exploration of the subconscious and
childlike imagination</li>
<li>As a teacher at the Bauhaus, Klee’s theories and practice profoundly
shaped modern art and design education</li>
</ul>
