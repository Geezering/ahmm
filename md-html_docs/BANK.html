<h1 id="bank-artist-collective---yba-in-london">BANK (Artist Collective)
- YBA in London</h1>
<h2 id="overview-and-reputation">Overview and Reputation</h2>
<ul>
<li>The group targeted the commercialisation, elitism, and jargon of the
contemporary art scene, using exhibitions, publications, and direct
interventions to critique and parody the art establishment[1][3]</li>
<li>Their reputation at the time was divisive: widely ignored by the
mainstream art press (notably Frieze and Art Monthly), they were
nonetheless infamous among artists and galleries for their relentless
and often abrasive institutional critique[1][3][5]</li>
<li>Today, BANK’s legacy is recognised as radical and influential, with
their archive and exhibitions still seen as potent, unique, and largely
unimitated[1]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-members-and-contributions">Key Members and
Contributions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Like all the core members, Bedwell helped shape BANK’s satirical
manifestos, tabloid-style publications, and the infamous
“Fax-Baks”—mocked-up corrections of gallery press releases sent back to
their sources as a form of institutional critique[1][3][5]</li>
<li><strong>John Russell</strong>: Early collaborator with Bedwell,
involved in the merging of artist groups that became BANK</li>
<li>Russell contributed to the group’s exhibitions and helped develop
their collaborative, anti-authorial approach[5]</li>
<li><strong>Milly Thompson</strong>: Core member, responsible for
archiving BANK’s output and curatorial contributions to later
exhibitions</li>
<li>Thompson also helped maintain the group’s distinctive visual and
textual style[1]</li>
<li><strong>Andrew Williamson</strong>: Contributing to exhibitions and
the group’s critical discourse and offered reflections on the group’s
internal culture and boundaries[1]</li>
<li><strong>David (Dave) Burrows</strong>: Sometime-member, known for
his participation in two early BANK shows and performances</li>
<li>Burrows brought an outsider’s perspective and contributed to the
group’s dynamic and occasionally contentious internal debates[1][3]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-projects-and-methods">Notable Projects and Methods</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cocaine Orgasm (often rendered as ‘Cocaine
Rogasm’):</strong></li>
<li>The show lampooned the excesses and hedonism of the contemporary art
world, particularly the Young British Artists (YBAs) scene, by using
themes of drug culture, sensationalism, and tabloid aesthetics</li>
<li>The exhibition’s title and content were deliberately
confrontational, aiming to parody both the art market’s obsession with
notoriety and the media’s appetite for scandal</li>
<li><strong>Zombie Golf:</strong> This exhibition was another example of
BANK’s irreverent approach, using absurdity and black humour to critique
art-world trends and the commodification of creativity</li>
<li>The show likely featured installations and performances that played
with the idea of mindless repetition (as in “zombies”) and the leisure
industry (golf), satirising the emptiness of certain art practices and
the art market’s cyclical nature</li>
<li>Like many BANK projects, it was designed to be chaotic, funny, and
critical of contemporary art’s pretensions</li>
<li><strong>The Charge of the Light Brigade:</strong> BANK’s exhibition
by this name used the famous military disaster as a metaphor for the
quixotic, doomed, or misguided efforts of artists and institutions in
the art world</li>
<li>The show’s title evokes themes of heroism, futility, and blind
obedience—qualities BANK often parodied in their critique of the art
establishment</li>
<li>The exhibition included collaborative installations, paintings,
satirical texts, and performative elements, all designed to lampoon the
seriousness and self-importance of the art industry</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="banks-fuck-off-exhibition">BANK’s “Fuck Off” Exhibition</h3>
<ul>
<li>The exhibition titled <strong>“Fuck Off”</strong> was staged by the
BANK collective in 1996 in London, continuing their tradition of
aggressive, immersive, and polemical group shows that satirised and
critiqued the contemporary art scene of the 1990s[1][2][3]</li>
<li>It was part of a series of exhibitions with provocative titles such
as <em>Zombie Golf</em> and <em>Cocaine Orgasm</em>, designed to lampoon
the art world’s pretensions, commercialism, and hype[1]</li>
<li>Like their other shows, <em>Fuck Off</em> was held in temporary
warehouse spaces (e.g., BANKSPACE, DOG, Galerie Poo-Poo), featuring
sprawling installations that combined humour, chaos, and institutional
critique</li>
<li>The exhibition included contributions from a range of artists
associated with BANK and the wider London scene, such as Martin Creed,
Peter Doig, Matthew Higgs, Chris Ofili, Gavin Turk, and others[1]</li>
<li>The show’s title, <em>Fuck Off</em>, encapsulated the collective’s
anarchic and confrontational stance toward the art establishment,
reflecting a refusal to conform to the expectations and etiquette of
galleries, critics, and the commercial art market[1][2]</li>
<li>BANK’s approach involved “anti-curating,” deliberately subverting
conventional exhibition formats and promotional strategies to expose the
art world’s contradictions and absurdities[2]</li>
<li>BANK’s infamous “Fax-Bak” project—sending back corrected and
sarcastic versions of gallery press releases—exemplified the same spirit
of institutional critique present in <em>Fuck Off</em> and other
exhibitions[1][2]</li>
<li>The exhibition was part of a broader practice that combined lowbrow
humour, punk-like attitude, and serious critique, making <em>Fuck
Off</em> a memorable moment in 1990s British contemporary art</li>
<li><strong>The reception at the time was mixed:</strong> largely
ignored or dismissed by mainstream art press but influential and
notorious within artist circles and alternative art spaces[1][2][3]</li>
<li>Today, <em>Fuck Off</em> is seen as emblematic of BANK’s unique
legacy—radical, funny, and still potent as a critique of art-world
systems[2]</li>
<li>BANK’s <em>Fuck Off</em> exhibition (1996) was a quintessential
example of their anarchic institutional critique, using provocative
titles, immersive installations, and satirical strategies to challenge
the art world’s commercialism and pretension</li>
<li>It remains a significant episode in the history of British
artist-led practice and the Young British Artists era</li>

<p>###“Fax-Bak”</p>
<ul>
<li>BANK’s most infamous project was the “Fax-Bak” series, in which they
returned gallery press releases with sarcastic, pedantic, and often rude
corrections, lampooning the pretentiousness and vacuity of art-world
language[1][2]</li>
<li>They also produced a satirical magazine with headlines mocking the
art establishment and its personalities[3]</li>
<li>Their exhibitions, such as “STOP SHORT-CHANGING US - POPULAR CULTURE
IS FOR IDIOTS!</li>
<li>WE BELIEVE IN ART.”, were deliberately shambolic, funny, and
provocative, aiming to disrupt the norms of curation and
promotion[1]</li>
<li>BANK’s approach was collaborative but often described as
“dysfunctional,” with a “surly, self-destructive, self-conscious,
introspective attitude” that was both critical and
self-critical[3][5]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reputation-then-and-now">Reputation Then and Now</h2>
<ul>
<li>Their work was sometimes dismissed as mere mischief, but members
insist it was a serious continuation of avant-garde critique, especially
at a time when the art market and curatorial industry were becoming
increasingly dominant[1]</li>
<li>In retrospect, BANK’s work is regarded as prescient and still
relevant, especially in its critique of art-world professionalisation
and jargon</li>
<li>Their archive is seen as unique and potent, with a level of
radicalism and humour that remains largely unplagiarised[1]</li>
<li>While some of their offensiveness is now viewed as tame, their
willingness to “say the unsayable” and challenge institutional norms has
secured their place in the history of British contemporary
art[1][3][5]</li>
<li>“BANK seems to still stand for radicalism – I’m surprised at the
continuing level of interest (and delighted), the work we made still
doesn’t look like anything else I think, and maybe there’s potency in
something that has not been sort of plagiarised in one way or another.”
– Milly Thompson[1]</li>
