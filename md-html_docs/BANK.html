<h1 id="bank-artist-collective---yba-in-london">BANK (Artist Collective) – YBA in London</h1>

<h2 id="overview-and-reputation">Overview and Reputation</h2>
<p>
  BANK was a London-based artist collective active throughout the 1990s. The group is renowned for its satirical assault on the commercialisation, elitism, and pretentious jargon of the contemporary art world. Through exhibitions, publications, and direct interventions, BANK became infamous for institutional critique and parody—often ignored by mainstream art press but notorious among artists and alternative spaces.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Challenged the seriousness and self-importance of the 1990s British art scene through humour, chaos, and collaborative projects.</li>
  <li>Known for abrasive and irreverent attacks on galleries, dealers, curators, and the Young British Artists (YBAs).</li>
  <li>Despite being overlooked at the time by magazines like <em>Frieze</em> and <em>Art Monthly</em>, BANK’s unique legacy is now recognised as radical, influential, and almost impossible to imitate.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="key-members-and-contributions">Key Members and Contributions</h2>

<h2 id="notable-projects-and-methods">Notable Projects and Methods</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Cocaine Orgasm (aka “Cocaine Rogasm”):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Mocked the excess, sensationalism, and hedonism of the YBA scene through themes of drug culture and tabloid spectacle.</li>
      <li>Title and content deliberately provocative, parodying both the art market’s fixation on notoriety and the media’s taste for scandal.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Zombie Golf:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Critiqued art world “mindlessness” and commodification with absurd, black humour.</li>
      <li>Played with ideas of repetition (zombies) and leisure (golf), satirising emptiness in art market cycles.</li>
      <li>Typical BANK style: chaotic, anti-pretentious, mocking art-industry trends.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Charge of the Light Brigade:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Used the metaphor of heroic failure to satirically address artists and institutions in the art world.</li>
      <li>References themes of heroism, futility, and conformity, turned upside down to highlight the art world’s excesses and missteps.</li>
      <li>Included collaborative installations, satirical texts, and performative elements to disrupt expectations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bank-fuck-off-exhibition">BANK’s "Fuck Off" Exhibition</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>"Fuck Off"</strong> (1996) was BANK’s most notorious group show, staged in temporary East London warehouse spaces such as BANKSPACE and Galerie Poo-Poo.</li>
  <li>Used aggressive, immersive installations and deliberately provocative titles to satirise the art world’s pretensions, commercialism, and hypocrisy.</li>
  <li>Featured sprawling, chaotic installations and included contributions from artists like Martin Creed, Peter Doig, Matthew Higgs, Chris Ofili, and Gavin Turk.</li>
  <li>The show was a conscious rejection of gallery etiquette and institutional expectations, embodying what BANK called "anti-curating".</li>
  <li>BANK’s infamous “Fax-Bak” project (sarcastic corrections of gallery press releases) operated in tandem, emphasising their commitment to exposing art-world absurdities and jargon.</li>
  <li>Reception was mixed: ignored by most of the mainstream press, yet influential within artists’ circles for its anarchic, critical energy.</li>
  <li><em>"Fuck Off"</em> is now seen as a defining moment in artist-led critique, using satire, confrontation, and humour to challenge the boundaries of contemporary art.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fax-bak-references">"Fax-Bak" Project & Public Interventions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Most infamous project: returning gallery press releases “corrected” with sarcastic, rude, or pedantic annotations to ridicule art-world jargon and emptiness.</li>
  <li>Published satirical magazines and flyers with headlines that mocked art industry personalities and hype.</li>
  <li>Exhibitions were deliberately shambolic and antagonistic, designed to disrupt curation and gallery conventions.</li>
  <li>BANK’s collective process was criticism-rich, sometimes dysfunctional, and defiantly non-corporate—focusing as much on self-critique as on lampooning others.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="legacy-and-reputation">Legacy and Reputation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>BANK’s antics were often dismissed as prankish, but members saw their actions as a vital, ironic extension of avant-garde critique, especially amid growing art-market professionalisation.</li>
  <li>In retrospect, their critique of the rising "curatorial industry" and art-sale processes is viewed as prescient and still highly relevant.</li>
  <li>The group is remembered for their radical humour, unpolished style, and willingness to “say the unsayable"—qualities that remain largely unplagiarised today.</li>
  <li>As Milly Thompson said: “BANK seems to still stand for radicalism... the work we made still doesn’t look like anything else... maybe there’s potency in something that has not been sort of plagiarised.”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary for Students</h2>
<ul>
  <li>BANK used satire, humour, and direct action to parody London’s 1990s art world and critique commercial and curatorial trends.</li>
  <li>Projects and exhibitions were deliberately chaotic, mocking the self-importance and jargon of the establishment and questioning what makes art valuable or meaningful.</li>
  <li>The group’s legacy is defined by radical, original institutional critique and serves as an example of how artists can challenge the art world from within.</li>
</ul>
