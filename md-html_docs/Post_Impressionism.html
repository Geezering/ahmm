<h2 id="core-ideas">Core Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="personal-expression">Personal Expression</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Artists focused on expressing feelings, memories, and ideas through their work—not just copying what they saw.</li>
  <li>They used bold, sometimes unnatural colours and dramatic brushstrokes to show mood and emotion.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="experimentation">Experimentation with Form and Colour</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Many experimented with shapes and new ways of arranging pictures, often using patterns or geometry.</li>
  <li>Cézanne used structured brushwork and simplified forms; Seurat and Signac developed pointillism—painting with dots of pure colour.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="symbolism-abstraction">Symbolism and Abstraction</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Post-Impressionists introduced symbols and abstract elements—using colours, shapes, and composition to suggest deeper meanings or personal stories.</li>
  <li>This paved the way for movements like Cubism and Expressionism where meaning became as important as realistic appearance.</li>

<h2 id="ideas-perceptual-conceptual">Key Ideas: Perceptual and Conceptual Art</h2>

<h3 id="post-impressionism-characteristics">What Is Post-Impressionism?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Post-Impressionist artists all had separate approaches. There is no single style, but they shared the goal of moving beyond direct observation to express ideas and emotions.</li>
  <li>Post-Impressionists are often described as 'conceptual artists'—interested in ideas and meaning, not just appearance.</li>
  <li>Impressionism was 'perceptual': it aimed to capture what a scene looks like for a moment in time, like a photograph.</li>
  <li>By contrast, conceptual artists used images as diagrams or maps—presenting thoughts and ideas that could not be seen from one viewpoint.</li>
</ul>

</span>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Perceptual art:</strong> Captures how a place appears at one time and in one light (like a photo).</li>
  <li><strong>Conceptual art:</strong> Shows ideas, plans, or information—sometimes combining different viewpoints, or showing things that cannot be seen directly.</li>
