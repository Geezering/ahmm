<h2 id="key-themes-ideas-and-artistic-aspects">Key Themes, Ideas, and
Artistic Aspects</h2>
<h3 id="personal-expression-and-emotional-impact">Personal Expression
and Emotional Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Post-Impressionist artists moved beyond simply capturing what they
saw, focusing instead on expressing their own feelings, memories, and
ideas through their art</li>
<li>They often used bold, unnatural colours and dramatic brushstrokes to
show emotion or mood, rather than just copying real life</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="experimentation-with-form-colour-and-structure">Experimentation
with Form, Colour, and Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many Post-Impressionists experimented with geometric shapes,
patterns, and new ways of organising their paintings</li>
<li>Some, like Cézanne, used structured brushwork and simplified forms,
while others, like Seurat and Signac, developed pointillism (painting
with tiny dots of colour)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="symbolism-and-abstraction">Symbolism and Abstraction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Post-Impressionists often included symbolic or abstract elements in
their work, using colour, shape, and composition to suggest deeper
meanings or personal stories</li>
<li>This set the stage for later movements like Cubism and
Expressionism, as artists became more interested in what art could mean,
not just what it could show</li>

<h1 id="main-post-impressionist-artists">Main Post-Impressionist
Artists</h1>
<h2 id="paul-cézanne">Paul Cézanne</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cézanne</strong> is often called the “father of
Post-Impressionism.” He wanted to bring structure and order back into
painting, which he felt Impressionism lacked.</li>
<li>Cézanne used careful brushstrokes and often broke objects down into
simple shapes, like cylinders and spheres, giving his paintings a solid,
almost sculptural feel. His use of colour was bold, but always carefully
planned.</li>
<li>Cézanne’s approach influenced many later artists, especially those
who developed Cubism.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vincent-van-gogh">Vincent van Gogh</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Van Gogh</strong> is famous for his vibrant colours and
swirling, energetic brushwork.</li>
<li>He used paint in thick layers and chose colours not just to show
what things looked like, but to express his feelings and moods.</li>
<li>Van Gogh’s paintings often seem full of movement and emotion, making
them instantly recognisable.</li>
<li>Although he struggled with mental health and was not successful in
his lifetime, his work is now some of the most celebrated in art
history.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="paul-gauguin">Paul Gauguin</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gauguin</strong> broke away from painting what he saw in
front of him and instead used colour and shape to create a sense of
mystery and symbolism.</li>
<li>He often painted scenes from his travels, especially in Tahiti,
using flat areas of bold colour and strong outlines.</li>
<li>Gauguin wanted his art to show dreams, myths, and ideas, not just
everyday life.</li>
<li>His style influenced many artists who wanted to go beyond simply
copying nature.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="georges-seurat">Georges Seurat</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seurat</strong> developed a technique called pointillism,
where he painted with tiny dots of pure colour that blend together when
seen from a distance.</li>
<li>He was very scientific in his approach, carefully planning how
colours would interact to create light and shadow.</li>
<li>Seurat’s paintings are calm and organised, with a sense of order and
harmony. His most famous work, “A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La
Grande Jatte,” shows this technique at its best.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="henri-de-toulouse-lautrec">Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toulouse-Lautrec</strong> is known for his lively scenes of
Parisian nightlife, especially in places like the Moulin Rouge.</li>
<li>He used bold lines and bright colours to capture the energy and
excitement of cabarets, dancers, and performers.</li>
<li>His style was influenced by posters and Japanese prints, making his work look modern and striking.</li>
<li>Toulouse-Lautrec’s art gives us a glimpse into the vibrant world of
late 19th-century Paris.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="post-impressionism-was..">Post Impressionism was..</h2>
<ul>
<li>These artists all reacted against Impressionism in different ways.
It is difficult, then, to say ‘what Post Impressionism was’ since all of these artists have separate ideas, programmes and methods.</li>
<li>We can say that they shared a desire to go beyond just painting what they saw, using colour, shape, and technique to express ideas, emotions,
and personal visions.</li>
<li>We can also say that they were all conceptual artists and not
perceptual artists.</li>
<li><strong>Impressionism was a perceptual art form</strong>: it was painting that showed you what you see before you at a certain time and a particular place. Like a photograph does.</li>
<li><strong>By contrast, conceptual art</strong> introduces the idea of painting and identifying ideas, structures, and concepts that are not visual. What this means is that the picture does not function as a record of how the subject is perceived at a particular and unique time and place, but instead, conceptual paintings serve as diagrams of ideas that people can share about things.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="perceptual-and-conceptual-art">Perceptual and Conceptual
art</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perceptual art</strong>: a photo of a location at a given
time under given lighting conditions, weather, etc</li>
<li><strong>Conceptual art</strong>: a diagram, a map or a plan that can
present information from different view points or schematically show what can’t be seen from one viewpoint.</li>
</ul>
