<h1 id="feminist-art">Feminist Art (1955–1990)</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
  Feminist Art emerged to confront gender stereotypes and challenge the exclusion of women from art history. Artists addressed women's experiences, used new materials, practised activism, critiqued institutions, and fostered community. This movement influenced wider debates about identity, power, and equality in culture and society.
