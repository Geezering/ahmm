<h1 id="three-short-points">Three Short Points</h1>
<h2 id="challenging-gender-stereotypes-and-representation">Challenging
Gender Stereotypes and Representation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Feminist artists such as Judy Chicago, Barbara Kruger, and the
Guerrilla Girls directly confronted the way women were traditionally
shown in art and society</li>
<li>They exposed how women were often reduced to passive objects or
stereotypes, and instead created works that celebrated women’s
experiences, bodies, and achievements</li>
<li>Many used their own lives and identities as material, aiming to
rewrite art history from a female perspective and make women visible in
spaces where they had been ignored or excluded</li>
</ul>
<h2
id="experimenting-with-materials-and-breaking-art-boundaries">Experimenting
with Materials and Breaking Art Boundaries</h2>
<ul>
<li>Feminist art was not tied to a single style or medium</li>
<li>Artists used performance, video, photography, textiles, embroidery,
and installations-materials and techniques often dismissed as “women’s
work”-to question what counted as “real” art</li>
<li>For example, Judy Chicago’s The Dinner Party used ceramics and
embroidery to honour historical women, while Yoko Ono’s performances and
Eva Hesse’s sculptures pushed the boundaries of what art could be</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="activism-institutional-critique-and-community">Activism,
Institutional Critique, and Community</h2>
<ul>
<li>The movement was deeply activist, with artists protesting against
sexism in galleries and museums, forming collectives (like the Guerrilla
Girls), and demanding equal rights and opportunities for women in the
art world</li>
<li>They critiqued the male-dominated art establishment, highlighted
issues like violence against women, and created supportive spaces for
women and minority artists</li>
<li>Their work paved the way for later movements focused on identity,
race, and sexuality</li>
