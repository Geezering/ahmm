Figurative and Expressive Painting</h3>

recognisable people, objects, or scenes) and expressive brushwork after
a period dominated by conceptual art (where the idea is more important
than the image)</li>

dramatic, using techniques that show the artist’s feelings and
energy</li>

and Present-Myth, History, and Symbolism</h3>
