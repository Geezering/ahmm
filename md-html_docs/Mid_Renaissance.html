<h1 id="mid-renaissance">Mid Renaissance</h1>
<ul>
<li>Mid Renaissance artists aimed to make their paintings look realistic
and three-dimensional</li>
<li>They used techniques like linear perspective (making things look
further away by drawing them smaller and converging lines), chiaroscuro
(shading to create light and shadow), and careful study of human anatomy
to give depth and life to their figures and scenes</li>
<li>This made their art look much more like real life compared to the
flat, stylised art of the Middle Ages</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="humanism-and-classical-influence">Humanism and Classical
Influence</h2>
<ul>
<li>These artists were inspired by the ideas and art of ancient Greece
and Rome, a movement called humanism</li>
<li>They focused on people’s individuality, emotions, and achievements,
often painting not just religious stories but also portraits, myths, and
scenes from daily life</li>
<li>Artists like Botticelli aimed for harmony, balance, and beauty,
showing humans as central and important in the universe</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="innovation-and-patronage">Innovation and Patronage</h2>
<ul>
<li>The period saw many new artistic techniques and materials, supported
by wealthy patrons like the Medici family in Florence</li>
<li>Artists became more respected as creative thinkers, not just
craftsmen</li>

helping spread Renaissance ideas across Italy and beyond</li>
