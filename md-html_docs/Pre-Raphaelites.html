<h1 id="pre-raphaelites">Pre-Raphaelites (1848–1870)</h1>
<p>
  The Pre-Raphaelites were a group of artists and writers in Victorian England who aimed to make art more sincere, vibrant, and truthful. They championed careful observation of nature, vivid stories from legend and literature, and a return to medieval inspiration.

<h2 id="key-themes">Key Themes &amp; Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="naturalism-detail">Naturalism &amp; Vivid Detail</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pre-Raphaelite artists aimed for striking realism and sharp clarity, closely studying the natural world.</li>
  <li>Their paintings have intense colours and show minute details—each leaf, flower, or hair is painted with care so the scene looks almost photographic.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="medievalism-symbolism">Medievalism, Symbolism &amp; Storytelling</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Inspired by medieval art and poetry, they painted scenes from myth, legend, and literature.</li>
  <li>Objects and settings are symbolic—a flower might represent love or sorrow, and every detail carries meaning.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rebellion-against-academy">Rebellion Against Academic Art &amp; Industrialisation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The group rejected the set styles of the Royal Academy, preferring direct, emotional, and sincere subjects.</li>
