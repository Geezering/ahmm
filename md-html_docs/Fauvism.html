(1904–1907): Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects</h1>
<h1 id="three-short-points">Three Short Points</h1>
<h2 id="bold-unnatural-colour-and-expressive-brushwork">Bold, Unnatural
Colour and Expressive Brushwork</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fauvist artists like Henri Matisse, André Derain, and Maurice de
Vlaminck used pure, vivid colours straight from the tube, often in
unexpected ways-trees could be blue, faces green, skies red</li>
<li>Their brushstrokes were energetic and sometimes rough, creating a
sense of movement and emotion rather than aiming for realism</li>
<li>Colour was used to express feeling, not to copy what things actually
look like in real life</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="simplified-forms-and-spontaneous-composition">Simplified Forms
and Spontaneous Composition</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Fauves rejected traditional rules about perspective and
shading</li>
<li>They simplified shapes and often made their paintings look flat,
with little attempt to show depth or realistic light and shadow</li>
<li>Their compositions were spontaneous and impulsive, with quick,
gestural lines and a focus on the artist’s personal response to the
subject, rather than careful planning or detail</li>
</ul>
<h2
id="rebellion-against-tradition-and-focus-on-individual-expression">Rebellion
Against Tradition and Focus on Individual Expression</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fauvism was a radical break from the past, inspired by
Post-Impressionists like Van Gogh and Gauguin but going further in
freeing colour and form from their traditional roles</li>
<li>The movement encouraged artists to paint what they felt, not just
what they saw, making each work a powerful expression of the artist’s
own emotions and imagination</li>
<li>This approach shocked viewers at the time and led to the artists
being nicknamed “wild beasts” (les fauves) because of their untamed
style</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="key-artists">Key Artists:</h2>
<h3 id="henri-matisse">Henri Matisse</h3>
<ul>
<li>Matisse was the leader of Fauvism, known for his use of bold,
emotive colours, simplified shapes, and expressive brushwork that broke
away from traditional representation</li>
<li>He often exaggerated colours to convey emotion rather than depict
reality, and his work ranged from vibrant paintings to innovative paper
cut-outs in later years</li>
<li>Matisse’s approach prioritised the arrangement of colour planes and
decorative composition, making his art joyful, energetic, and highly
influential within the movement</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="maurice-vlaminck">Maurice Vlaminck</h3>
<ul>
<li>Vlaminck was a “natural” Fauvist whose exuberant personality matched
his intense, vivid use of colour, influenced by seeing Van Gogh’s
work</li>
<li>His paintings are marked by impulsive brushwork and a raw, emotional
response to nature, often using non-naturalistic colours to heighten
expression</li>
<li>Vlaminck’s approach was spontaneous and energetic, helping to define
the wild, untamed spirit of Fauvism</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="andré-derain">André Derain</h3>
<ul>
<li>Derain, working closely with Matisse, introduced unnaturalistic
colour and vivid brushstrokes to his landscapes and portraits,
especially during their time in Collioure</li>
<li>His style balanced the impulsiveness of Vlaminck with the control of
Matisse, resulting in vibrant yet harmonious compositions</li>
<li>Derain’s Fauvist works are known for their decorative use of colour
and simplified forms, though he later moved towards a more restrained
palette and structure</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="georges-braque">Georges Braque</h3>
<ul>
<li>Braque joined the Fauves in 1906, adopting their use of pure,
intense colour and loose, expressive brushwork</li>
<li>His Fauvist period was brief, as he soon became a pioneer of Cubism,
but his early works display the movement’s characteristic vibrancy and
emotional directness</li>
<li>Braque’s Fauvist paintings often focused on landscape, using colour
as a primary means of expression rather than realistic depiction</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="raoul-dufy">Raoul Dufy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dufy was drawn to the bright palette and decorative qualities of
Fauvism, creating lively scenes full of light and movement</li>
<li>His work is characterised by fluid lines, simplified shapes, and a
joyful, optimistic use of colour</li>
<li>Dufy’s Fauvist style brought a sense of playfulness and spontaneity
to the movement, particularly in his depictions of leisure and coastal
life</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kees-van-dongen">Kees van Dongen</h3>
<ul>
<li>Van Dongen was known for his striking portraits, using exaggerated
colours and bold outlines to heighten emotional impact</li>
<li>His Fauvist works often depicted nightlife, performers, and
fashionable women, rendered with a vivid, sometimes provocative
palette</li>
<li>Van Dongen’s approach embodied the wild and expressive energy of
Fauvism, making his paintings instantly recognisable</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="georges-rouault">Georges Rouault</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rouault’s Fauvist paintings combined intense colour with heavy black
outlines, giving his figures a stained-glass appearance</li>
<li>He focused on deeply emotional and spiritual subjects, using the
Fauvist palette to convey inner turmoil and compassion</li>
<li>Rouault’s work stands out for its sombre mood and expressive
distortion, showing the movement’s potential for psychological
depth</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="albert-marquet">Albert Marquet</h3>
<ul>
<li>Marquet’s Fauvist works are noted for their subtle yet vibrant use
of colour and simplified, fluid forms</li>
<li>He often painted landscapes and cityscapes, capturing light and
atmosphere with broad, expressive brushstrokes</li>
<li>Marquet’s contribution to Fauvism was a quieter, more contemplative
approach, balancing the movement’s exuberance with a sense of calm</li>
</ul>
