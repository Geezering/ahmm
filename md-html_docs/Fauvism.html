<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
  Fauvism was a bold, short-lived art movement in early 20th-century France, characterised by wild colours and expressive brushwork. The name “Fauves” means “wild beasts” in French, describing the artists’ untamed and emotional style.

<h2 id="core-ideas">Core Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="bold-colour">Bold Colour and Expressive Brushwork</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Artists like <strong>Henri Matisse</strong>, <strong>André Derain</strong>, and <strong>Maurice de Vlaminck</strong> used pure, vivid colours straight from the tube—trees might be blue, faces green, skies red.</li>
  <li>Brushstrokes were energetic and rough, creating movement and emotion instead of realism.</li>
  <li>Colour was used to express feelings, not to imitate nature.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="simplified-forms">Simplified Forms and Spontaneity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fauves rejected traditional rules about depth, perspective, and shading.</li>
  <li>Shapes were simplified and often appear flat, with little attempt to show depth or realistic light and shadow.</li>
  <li>Compositions were spontaneous and impulsive, focused on the artist’s immediate response rather than careful planning.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="individual-expression">Rebellion and Individual Expression</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fauvism was a radical break from tradition, inspired by Post-Impressionist artists like Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Cézanne.</li>
  <li>Artists were encouraged to paint what they felt, not just what they saw, making each work personal and expressive.</li>
  <li>The approach shocked viewers and earned them the nickname “wild beasts” (les fauves) for their untamed style.</li>
