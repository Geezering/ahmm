Aspects</h1>
<h3 id="jan-van-eyck">Jan van Eyck</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mastery of Oil Painting and Detail:</strong> Van Eyck
perfected the use of oil paints, which allowed him to create incredibly
detailed and realistic images, with lifelike textures, reflections, and
subtle light effects[2][7][10]</li>
<li><strong>Symbolism and Realism:</strong> His works are full of
symbolic objects (like mirrors, candles, and fruit) that often have
hidden meanings, blending religious themes with scenes from everyday
life[8][11]</li>
<li><strong>Portraiture and Perspective:</strong> Van Eyck was a pioneer
in portrait painting, using careful observation and empirical
perspective (making things look real by how they appear to the eye) to
create convincing, three-dimensional spaces and lifelike
people[1][6][10]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="robert-campin">Robert Campin</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Naturalism and Everyday Settings:</strong> Campin brought
religious stories into familiar, domestic settings, making holy figures
appear as if they lived in ordinary Northern European homes[2][10]</li>
<li><strong>Attention to Materiality:</strong> He painted objects like
wood, metal, and fabric with great care, showing off their different
textures and making scenes feel tangible and real[2][10]</li>
<li><strong>Innovative Use of Oil Paint:</strong> Campin was among the
first to use oil paint for rich colours and fine details, allowing for
more realistic and expressive images[2][10]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rogier-van-der-weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emotional Expression:</strong> Van der Weyden’s paintings
are known for their intense emotion, especially in religious scenes,
where faces and gestures clearly show feelings like grief or
devotion[2][5][10]</li>
<li><strong>Composition and Clarity:</strong> He arranged figures and
spaces carefully to guide the viewer’s eye and make the story easy to
follow, often using strong lines and balanced groups[2][10]</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Realism:</strong> Like other Northern artists, he
was a master of detail, painting everything from tears to jewellery with
precision[2][10]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hans-memling">Hans Memling</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Serene and Gentle Figures:</strong> Memling’s portraits and
religious scenes are known for their calm, gentle faces and soft light,
creating a peaceful mood[2][1]</li>
<li><strong>Blending Sacred and Everyday:</strong> He often placed
religious figures in realistic, contemporary settings, making them
relatable to viewers of his time[2][1]</li>
<li><strong>Technical Skill:</strong> Memling’s smooth brushwork and
clear, bright colours show the technical brilliance of the Northern
Renaissance style[2][10]</li>
