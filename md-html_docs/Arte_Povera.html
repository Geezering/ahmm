<h2 id="intro">Key Facts and Context</h2>
<p>
  Arte Povera was a radical Italian art movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Its name means “poor art” in Italian, referring to the use of humble materials, not the quality of the art. Artists aimed to challenge ideas about value, artistic tradition, and the role of art in society. Their work was often surprising, thought-provoking, and connected to political and social change in Italy.
