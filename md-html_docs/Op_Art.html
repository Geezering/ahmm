<h2 id="key-themes-ideas-and-artistic-aspects">Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects</h2>

<h3 id="optical-illusions-and-visual-effects">Optical Illusions and Visual Effects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Op Art (Optical Art) creates striking visual illusions that trick the eye using precise patterns, lines, and colour contrasts.</li>
  <li>Geometric shapes and repeated patterns make artworks seem to move, vibrate, or warp, even though they are flat and still.</li>
  <li>These illusions explore how our eyes and brains process visual information—making us question what we see.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="precision-geometry-and-abstraction">Precision, Geometry, and Abstraction</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Op Art is highly precise and non-representational, using regular shapes like lines, squares, circles, and grids.</li>
  <li>It avoids depicting real-world objects or people, focussing instead on pure geometry and design to explore visual perception.</li>
  <li>Artists such as Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely are famous for their exact, planned patterns and strong visual effects.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="exploring-perception-and-viewer-experience">Exploring Perception and Viewer Experience</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Op Art is about how the viewer sees and experiences a work, not just what is painted.</li>
  <li>The art makes your eyes work—sometimes causing a sense of motion, dizziness, or visual vibration.</li>
  <li>This focus on optical experience was new in the 1960s, linking to scientific research on vision and perception.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="kinetic-art-closely-related">Kinetic Art (closely related)</h2>

<h2 id="three-short-points-for-students">Three Short Points for Students</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Op Art uses precise geometric patterns and colours to create optical illusions that make flat images appear to move.</li>
  <li>The movement focuses on visual perception, making the viewer’s experience and eye activity the main subject.</li>
  <li>Op Art was shaped by 1960s science and technology, and its bold, eye-catching designs influenced fashion and design of the time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="glossary-for-students">Glossary for Students</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Optical illusion:</strong> Your eyes are tricked into seeing something that isn’t really happening (like movement in a still painting).</li>
  <li><strong>Abstract:</strong> Art that does not represent real things, but uses shapes, colours, and patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>Geometric:</strong> Made up of regular shapes—squares, circles, lines, grids, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Perception:</strong> How our senses (especially eyes) help us experience and understand the world.</li>
</ul>
