<h2 id="three-short-points">Three Short Points</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Late Modernism focused on abstraction: large areas of pure colour, simple shapes, and clear, flat surfaces.</li>
  <li>Artists aimed to remove personal emotion, using repeated patterns, hard edges, and sometimes industrial techniques for an impersonal look.</li>
  <li>They explored new materials, techniques, and ways art interacts with gallery space, resulting in objective, visually impactful paintings.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="emphasis-on-abstraction-colour-and-form">Emphasis on Abstraction, Colour, and Form</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Artists like Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Ellsworth Kelly, and Frank Stella focused on large fields of pure colour, simple geometric forms, and flatness.</li>
  <li>Art removed references to the real world, concentrating on colour and form alone.</li>
  <li>This style—known as Post-Painterly Abstraction—was clean, precise, and not about the artist’s emotion or gesture.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reduction-of-personal-expression">Reduction of Personal Expression</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unlike Abstract Expressionism, Late Modernists sought to avoid displaying personal feelings or stories.</li>
  <li>They used regular patterns, crisp lines, and sometimes industrial methods to create a sense of objectivity.</li>
  <li>The focus was on the direct visual experience: “what you see is what you see.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="exploration-of-materials-and-space">Exploration of Materials and Space</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Experimented with acrylic paints, spraying techniques, and shaped canvases, making works with a machine-made appearance.</li>
  <li>Some works were shaped or large-scale, changing how viewers move and interact with them in a gallery.</li>
  <li>Clarity, order, and visual impact were prioritised over storytelling or decoration.</li>
