Modernism (1960–1970): Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects</h1>
<h2 id="three-short-points">Three Short Points</h2>
<h3 id="emphasis-on-abstraction-colour-and-form">Emphasis on
Abstraction, Colour, and Form</h3>
<ul>
<li>Late Modernist artists like Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Jules
Olitski, Ellsworth Kelly, and Frank Stella focused on abstraction, using
large areas of pure colour, simple geometric shapes, and clear, flat
surfaces</li>
<li>Their work often removed any reference to real-world objects,
concentrating instead on how colours and shapes interact on the
canvas</li>
<li>This style is sometimes called Post-Painterly Abstraction, which
means painting that is precise, clean, and not about the artist’s
emotions or dramatic brushwork</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reduction-of-personal-expression">Reduction of Personal
Expression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unlike earlier movements such as Abstract Expressionism, which were
about showing the artist’s feelings, Late Modernist painters aimed to
remove personal emotion from their art</li>
<li>They used repeated patterns, hard edges, and even industrial
processes to make their work look impersonal and objective</li>
<li>The focus was on the artwork as an object, not as a story or
message, and on the viewer’s direct, visual experience</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exploration-of-materials-and-space">Exploration of Materials and
Space</h3>
<ul>
<li>These artists experimented with new materials (like acrylic paints)
and techniques, creating works that often look machine-made</li>
<li>They were interested in how paintings relate to the space around
them, sometimes making shaped canvases or large-scale works that change
how you move through a gallery</li>
<li>Their art was about clarity, order, and the idea that “what you see
is what you see”</li>

and a move away from elaborate decoration</li>

<h2 id="key-artists">Key Artists:</h2>
<h3 id="morris-louis">Morris Louis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Morris Louis was a leading figure in Colour Field painting and the
Washington Color School, known for his innovative use of the soak-stain
technique, where thinned acrylic paint was poured onto unprimed canvas
to create luminous, flowing veils of colour</li>
<li>His works are characterised by their emphasis on pure colour,
flatness, and the absence of gestural brushwork, focusing instead on the
optical and emotional effects of colour itself</li>
<li>Louis’s approach helped redefine the possibilities of abstract
painting in the post-war era, influencing generations of artists
interested in process and materiality</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kenneth-noland">Kenneth Noland</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kenneth Noland was a central figure in Colour Field painting and the
Washington Color School, renowned for his use of simple geometric forms
such as circles (targets), chevrons, and stripes, often painted in
vibrant, contrasting colours</li>
<li>He adopted the soak-stain technique, allowing thinned paint to seep
into unprimed canvas, which resulted in luminous, flat fields of colour
that emphasised the relationship between the image and the edge of the
canvas</li>
<li>Noland’s work explored the structural and emotional possibilities of
colour, and his shaped canvases and bold compositions played a
significant role in the development of postwar American abstraction</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jules-olitski">Jules Olitski</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jules Olitski was a key Colour Field painter, celebrated for his
atmospheric, spray-painted canvases that created subtle gradations and
fields of colour without visible brushstrokes</li>
<li>He experimented with different techniques, including using spray
guns to apply paint, achieving a sense of depth and luminosity through
layers of colour</li>
<li>Olitski’s work is noted for its focus on the sensory and spatial
effects of colour, contributing to the evolution of abstract painting in
the 1960s and 1970s</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ellsworth-kelly">Ellsworth Kelly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ellsworth Kelly was known for his hard-edged, minimalist paintings
that featured bold, unmodulated colours and simple geometric shapes,
often presented on shaped canvases</li>
<li>His art emphasised form, colour, and spatial relationships,
rejecting illusionism and focusing on the direct visual impact of pure
colour and shape</li>
<li>Kelly’s approach influenced both Colour Field painting and
Minimalism, and his work remains celebrated for its clarity, precision,
and visual power</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="frank-stella">Frank Stella</h3>
<ul>
<li>Frank Stella emerged as a leading figure in postwar abstraction,
pioneering shaped canvases and geometric compositions that rejected
expressive brushwork in favour of flat, hard-edged patterns</li>
<li>His early “Black Paintings” and later, vividly coloured works,
emphasised repetition, symmetry, and the materiality of the canvas
itself</li>
<li>Stella’s mantra, “What you see is what you see,” encapsulates his
commitment to non-representational, self-referential art, making him a
key influence on both Minimalism and Colour Field painting</li>
</ul>
