(1870–1880): Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects</h1>
<h2 id="three-short-points">Three Short Points</h2>
<h3 id="capturing-light-colour-and-the-moment">Capturing Light, Colour,
and the Moment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Impressionist artists like Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, and
Pierre-Auguste Renoir focused on painting the effects of light and
colour as they appeared at a specific moment in time</li>
<li><b>They used visible, quick brushstrokes and often painted outdoors</b> (en
plein air) to show how sunlight, shadows, and reflections changed
throughout the day</li>
<li>Their aim was not to create a perfect, detailed image, but to give
an impression of what they saw and felt in that instant</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="everyday-life-and-modern-subjects">Everyday Life and Modern
Subjects</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instead of painting grand historical or mythological scenes,
Impressionists chose ordinary, modern subjects:</strong> city streets,
train stations, gardens, dancers, and people at leisure</li>
<li>Artists like Edgar Degas and Mary Cassatt showed scenes of daily
life, often with unusual viewpoints, as if glimpsed by chance</li>
<li>This made their art feel fresh, spontaneous, and connected to the
world around them</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="innovative-techniques-and-rejection-of-tradition">Innovative
Techniques and Rejection of Tradition</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Impressionists broke the rules of traditional art</b> by using loose,
broken brushwork, pure unmixed colours, and open compositions where the
subject sometimes blends into the background</li>
<li>They abandoned the careful, smooth finish of academic painting,
making their works look sketchy or unfinished to critics at the
time</li>
<li>Advances in paint technology (like paint in tubes) and new ideas
about colour helped them work more freely and quickly outdoors</li>
