<h2 id="blurring-the-line-between-art-and-everyday-life">Blurring the Line Between Art and Everyday Life</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Neo-Dada artists used ordinary, found objects and popular imagery, making art from things like flags, targets, or even rubbish.</li>
  <li>They aimed to close the gap between art and daily life, showing that anything could be art and that art could be playful, surprising, or absurd.</li>
  <li>This approach challenged the traditional idea that art must be serious, beautiful, or made from special materials.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="irony-absurdity-and-viewer-interpretation">Irony, Absurdity, and Viewer Interpretation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The movement often relied on humour, nonsense, and unusual combinations to question the meaning of art and the world around us.</li>
  <li>Neo-Dada artists put less emphasis on personal feelings and more on making viewers think for themselves.</li>
  <li>They believed the meaning of an artwork comes from how people experience and interpret it, not just the artist's intent.</li>
  <li>Their art could be funny, confusing, or critical of consumer culture, encouraging people to question ideas of beauty and value.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="experimentation-collaboration-and-new-materials">Experimentation, Collaboration, and New Materials</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Neo-Dada artists experimented with a variety of materials and techniques, mixing painting, sculpture, performance, music, and dance.</li>
  <li>They worked collaboratively, often partnering with poets, musicians, and dancers to make interactive, unpredictable art.</li>
  <li>Their works sometimes looked unfinished or messy, breaking the rules of traditional artmaking.</li>
