Artistic Aspects</h2>
<h3 id="everyday-imagery-and-mass-culture">Everyday Imagery and Mass
Culture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pop Art artists used images from everyday life-like soup cans, comic
strips, adverts, and celebrities-to make art that felt modern and
relevant</li>
<li>They took inspiration from things people saw all around them,
turning ordinary objects into art and questioning what could be
considered “high” or “fine” art</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bold-colours-repetition-and-new-techniques">Bold Colours,
Repetition, and New Techniques</h3>
<ul>
<li>The movement is famous for its bright, eye-catching colours (often
primary colours), bold outlines, and repeated images</li>
<li>Artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein used techniques from
commercial printing, such as screen printing and Ben Day dots (tiny
coloured dots used in comics), to create works that looked mass-produced
and reflected consumer society</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="playfulness-irony-and-critique-of-consumerism">Playfulness,
Irony, and Critique of Consumerism</h3>

rise of consumer culture, fame, and advertising</li>

more accessible and fun, but also raising questions about materialism
and the media’s influence</li>
