<h1 id="new-expressionism-and-new-image-painting">New Expressionism and New Image Painting</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
  New Expressionism (also called Neo-Expressionism) and New Image Painting emerged in the late 1970s, reviving intense emotion, bold colours, and figurative imagery. Artists rejected the cool, detached styles of Minimalism and Conceptual Art, choosing instead to communicate raw feeling, personal stories, and social themes through energetic painting and mixed materials.
</p>

<h2 id="themes">Key Themes and Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="emotion-and-brushwork">Stylised Raw Emotion, Bold Colour, and Vigorous Brushwork</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Artworks are defined by thick, expressive-looking brushstrokes and vibrant, sometimes clashing, colours.</li>
  <li>Artists like <a href="#georg-baselitz-artist">Georg Baselitz</a>, <a href="#anselm-kiefer-artist">Anselm Kiefer</a>, and <a href="#julian-schnabel-artist">Julian Schnabel</a> created paintings that appear spontaneous, rough, or even violent.</li>
  <li>Works often feel immediate and powerful, communicating strong feeling and personal vision.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="figure-storytelling">Return to the Figure and Storytelling</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Instead of abstraction, these artists returned to recognisable images, especially human figures, though often distorted or cartoon-like.</li>
  <li>Their work tells stories or refers to history, myth, politics, or personal experiences.</li>
  <li>For example, Kiefer’s paintings address German history, while <a href="#jean-michel-quiat-artist">Basquiat</a> incorporated graffiti and text to reflect on identity and society.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mixing-and-breaking">Mixing Materials and Breaking Boundaries</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Artists combined paint with sand, fabric, found objects, collage, and more for a textured, tactile effect.</li>
  <li>The movement blurred lines between painting and sculpture, and between “high” art and popular culture, drawing inspiration from punk, <a href="Pop_Art.html">Pop Art</a>, and street art.</li>
  <li>This openness led to a rebellious, experimental spirit—and also contributed to art’s commercial boom in the 1980s.</li>
