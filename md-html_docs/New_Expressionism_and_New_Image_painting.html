Artistic Aspects</h2>
<h3 id="raw-emotion-bold-colour-and-vigorous-brushwork">Raw Emotion,
Bold Colour, and Vigorous Brushwork</h3>
<ul>
<li>New Expressionism (also called Neo-Expressionism) is known for its
intense emotional energy, using bold, sometimes jarring colours and
thick, expressive brushstrokes</li>
<li>Artists like Georg Baselitz, Anselm Kiefer, and Julian Schnabel
painted in a way that felt spontaneous and powerful, often on a large
scale</li>
<li>Their works show strong feelings and personal visions, sometimes
appearing rough or even violent in their execution</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="return-to-the-figure-and-storytelling">Return to the Figure and
Storytelling</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the abstract or minimalist art that came before, these
artists brought back recognisable images, especially the human figure,
but often in a distorted, exaggerated, or cartoon-like way</li>
<li>Many works tell stories or refer to history, myth, politics, or
personal experience</li>
<li>For example, Anselm Kiefer’s paintings often deal with German
history, while Jean-Michel - Basquiat used graffiti-like figures to
explore identity and society</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mixing-materials-and-breaking-boundaries">Mixing Materials and
Breaking Boundaries</h3>
<ul>
<li>New Image Painting and Neo-Expressionism often combined different
materials and techniques, such as sand, fabric, found objects, or
collage, alongside paint</li>
<li>This mixed-media approach made the artworks more textured and
physical</li>
<li>The movement also blurred the line between painting and sculpture,
and between “high” art and popular culture, drawing on influences from
punk, pop art, and street art</li>
