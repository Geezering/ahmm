<ul>
<li>Key Facts and Context</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="main-locations">Main location(s):</h2>

movements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Gothic and Romanesque art (characterised by flat, stylised figures
and religious themes)</li>
<li>Proto-Renaissance (artists like Giotto and Duccio began to move
towards naturalism and three-dimensionality in the 1300s)[1]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relevant-culture-and-politics">Relevant culture and
politics:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The rise of Humanism (a philosophy focusing on human potential,
individuality, and the study of classical antiquity)</li>
<li>Growth of wealthy merchant families (like the Medici) who became
important patrons of the arts[1][8]</li>
<li>Increasing interest in science, mathematics, and anatomy, which
influenced artists’ approach to realism and perspective[1][5]</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="relevant-writers-and-composers">Relevant writers and
Composers:</h1>
<h2 id="writers">Writers:</h2>

<h2 id="contemporary-inventions-and-technology">Contemporary Inventions
and Technology:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Development of linear perspective (using mathematics to create the
illusion of depth on a flat surface)[1][4]</li>
<li>Advances in anatomy and scientific observation, leading to more
realistic human figures[5]</li>
<li>Introduction of oil painting techniques (from Northern Europe), and
innovations in fresco and tempera painting[1][4]</li>

of the day for men and women:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Men:</strong> Doublets (close-fitting jackets), hose (tight
trousers), long tunics, and hats or caps</li>

</ul>
<h1 id="artists-and-period">Artists and Period:</h1>

Proto-Renaissance but hugely influential on the Early Renaissance

</ul>
<h2 id="key-themes-ideas-and-artistic-aspects">Key Themes, Ideas, and
Artistic Aspects</h2>
<h3 id="giotto">Giotto</h3>
<h4 id="naturalism-and-emotion">Naturalism and Emotion:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Giotto broke away from the flat, stylised figures of medieval art,
giving his figures weight, volume, and real human emotion</li>
<li>His frescoes, like those in the Scrovegni Chapel, show people with
believable gestures and faces[1]</li>
<li><strong>Three-Dimensional Space:</strong> He was one of the first to
create the illusion of depth, making figures appear to stand in real
space rather than float on a flat background[1]</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Giotto’s scenes are clear and
dramatic, making complex religious stories easy to understand through
expressive poses and simple, powerful compositions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="duccio">Duccio</h3>
<h4 id="transition-from-medieval-to-renaissance">Transition from
Medieval to Renaissance:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Duccio’s work bridges the gap between the Gothic style and the
new realism of the Renaissance, introducing softer lines and more
naturalistic figures #### Detailed Narrative Panels:</p></li>
<li><p>He often painted large altarpieces made up of many small panels,
each telling a different part of a religious story</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use of Colour and Texture:</strong> Duccio used rich
colours and delicate patterns to give his paintings a sense of beauty
and luxury, while still moving towards more realistic space and
figures</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="masaccio">Masaccio</h3>
<h4 id="pioneering-perspective">Pioneering Perspective:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Masaccio was the first to use linear perspective consistently,
making his paintings look convincingly three-dimensional[1][4]</p></li>
<li><p>He painted people with accurate anatomy and natural poses, using
light and shadow (chiaroscuro) to model their bodies and faces[1] ####
Emotional and Spiritual Depth:</p></li>
<li><p>Masaccio’s frescoes, like those in the Brancacci Chapel, combine
realism with deep emotion, making religious stories feel immediate and
human[3]</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="paolo-uccello">Paolo Uccello</h3>
<h4 id="obsession-with-perspective">Obsession with Perspective:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Uccello used mathematics to create dramatic, almost puzzle-like
scenes with precise, geometric perspective (as in his famous “Battle of
San Romano”)[1][4] #### Fusion of Gothic and Renaissance:</p></li>
<li><p>His work blends the decorative detail of Gothic art with the new
scientific approach to space and form #### Dynamic Composition:</p></li>
<li><p>Uccello’s paintings are full of movement and energy, using
foreshortening (making objects look shorter to show depth) and unusual
viewpoints</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-simple-terms-for-students">In Simple Terms for Students</h2>
<ul>
<li>Early Renaissance artists wanted to make art look real, using maths
and science to show depth, light, and anatomy accurately</li>
<li>They were inspired by ancient Greek and Roman art, but also wanted
to show real human emotions and everyday life, not just religious
stories</li>
<li>Their new techniques changed art forever, making paintings and
frescoes feel alive, believable, and full of meaning</li>
