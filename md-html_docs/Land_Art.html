<h1 id="land-art">Land Art (1970–1975)</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
  Land Art is an art movement where artists create works directly within landscapes, using earth, rocks, water, and other natural materials. These pieces are often monumental, inseparable from their locations, and can only be fully experienced in nature. Land Art developed as a reaction against traditional gallery systems and the commercial art world, focusing on process, site, experience, and our relationship with the environment.

<h2 id="quick-points">Key Points</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Art Made in Nature:</strong> Land Art uses the landscape as both material and setting, with works that often stretch across deserts, fields, or other remote sites.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Site-Specific and Ephemeral:</strong> These works are made for a single location, often temporary, changing or disappearing with time and weather.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Environmental Awareness:</strong> The movement questions consumerism and is closely linked to the 1970s environmental movement, drawing attention to nature’s beauty and fragility.
