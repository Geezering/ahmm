Artistic Aspects</h2>
<h3 id="shock-and-provocation">Shock and Provocation</h3>
<ul>
<li>YBA artists are known for using shock tactics-deliberately creating
art that is provocative or controversial</li>
<li>This could mean using unexpected materials (like animal remains in
Damien Hirst’s work) or exploring taboo subjects (such as Tracey Emin’s
confessional installations)</li>
<li>The aim is to challenge viewers’ expectations and spark debate about
what art can be</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="everyday-materials-and-conceptual-art">Everyday Materials and
Conceptual Art</h3>
<ul>
<li>Instead of traditional paint or sculpture, YBAs often use everyday
or industrial objects-like beds, kebabs, or even rubbish</li>
<li>This approach makes people question the value and meaning of art,
focusing on the idea behind the work rather than just how it looks</li>
<li>For example, Sarah Lucas’s sculptures use food and furniture to
comment on gender and identity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personal-and-cultural-commentary">Personal and Cultural
Commentary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many YBA works are autobiographical (about the artist’s own life) or
comment on wider social issues</li>
<li>They explore themes like identity, mortality (death and the meaning
of life), consumerism (the culture of buying things), and the media’s
influence</li>
<li>Tracey Emin’s My Bed and Gillian Wearing’s photographs of strangers
holding personal signs are examples of art that mixes personal
experience with broader cultural critique</li>
