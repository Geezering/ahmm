<h2 id="pure-abstraction-and-geometric-forms">Pure Abstraction and Geometric Forms</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Suprematism is an art movement based on pure abstraction—art that doesn’t represent real objects or people.</li>
  <li>Artists used basic geometric shapes like squares, circles, and rectangles, often painted in bold, flat colours.</li>
  <li>This is called non-objective art: it has no direct link to the real world—just shapes and colours for their own sake.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="supremacy-of-feeling-and-spirituality">Supremacy of Feeling and Spirituality</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Kazimir Malevich, the movement’s founder, argued that art should express pure artistic feeling, not copy the material world.</li>
  <li>Suprematist works were meant to connect with viewers spiritually, using simplicity and harmony to evoke deep emotion and a sense of higher meaning.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="minimalism-and-zero-point-of-art">Minimalism and the “Zero Point” of Art</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Suprematists reduced art to essentials, often using a limited colour palette (black, white, red, and primary colours) and avoiding any depth or storytelling.</li>
  <li>Malevich described this as reaching the “zero degree” of painting—beginning anew, without references to the past, just pure form and colour.</li>
