<h2 id="pure-abstraction-and-geometric-forms">Pure Abstraction and
Geometric Forms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Suprematism is all about pure abstraction-art that doesn’t try to
show real objects or people</li>
<li>Instead, artists used basic geometric shapes like squares, circles,
and rectangles, often painted in bold, flat colours</li>
<li>This style is called non-objective art, meaning it has no connection
to the physical world-just shapes and colours for their own sake</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="supremacy-of-feeling-and-spirituality">Supremacy of Feeling and
Spirituality</h2>
<ul>
<li>The movement’s founder, Kazimir Malevich, believed that art should
express pure artistic feeling, not copy the outside world</li>
<li>Suprematist works aimed to connect with viewers on a spiritual
level, using simplicity and harmony to evoke deep emotions and a sense
of higher existence</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="minimalism-and-the-zero-point-of-art">Minimalism and the “Zero
Point” of Art</h2>
<ul>
<li>Suprematists stripped art down to its essentials, using limited
colour palettes (often just black, white, red, and primary colours) and
avoiding any sense of depth or storytelling</li>
<li>Malevich called this the “zero degree” of painting-the idea of
starting fresh with no reference to the past, just pure form and
colour</li>

and the “zero point” of painting-a radical break from tradition that
influenced modern art</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="glossary-for-students">Glossary for Students:</h1>
