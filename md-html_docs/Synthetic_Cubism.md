# Synthetic Cubism

## Key Themes, Ideas, and Artistic Aspects

### Collage and Mixed Media

- Synthetic Cubism is famous for introducing collage (papier collé)-using real-world materials like newspaper, wallpaper, and fabric in artworks
- This broke traditional art boundaries by mixing painting with everyday objects, making viewers think about both the materials and the meaning of the work

### Simplified Shapes and Bright Colours

- Unlike earlier Cubism, which was complex and muted, Synthetic Cubism used simpler, clearer shapes and much brighter, bolder colours
- The subjects were easier to recognise, and artists often played with flatness and surface rather than trying to create depth

### Blurring Reality and Art

- Artists combined real objects with painted or drawn elements, creating a “synthesis” (mix) of reality and imagination
- This approach challenged the difference between high art and everyday life, and often included playful or symbolic references to popular culture and politics

# Contextual information

## Main location(s):

- Paris, France was the centre
- Also artists from Spain, Russia, Britain, the USA, and Mexico also contributed

## Relevant previous art movements:

- Analytical Cubism (the first phase of Cubism, focused on breaking down objects into complex shapes and multiple viewpoints)
- Post-Impressionism (art using bold colour and structure)
- Cézanne’s work (which inspired Cubist ideas about form and perspective)

## Relevant culture and politics:

- Early 20th-century Europe: A time of rapid change, new inventions, and social upheaval before and after World War I
- Artists responded to modern life, urbanisation, and the rise of mass media

# Relevant writers and Composers:

## Writers: 

- Guillaume Apollinaire (poet and art critic who supported Cubism)

## Composers:

- Igor Stravinsky (whose music was modern and experimental, like Cubist art)
- Erik Satie

# Contemporary inventions and technology:

- Widespread use of photography and early cinema
- Printing technology (newspapers, magazines, posters)
- New pigments and materials for artists

## Typical fashions of the day for men and women:

- **Men:** Tailored suits, bowler hats, waistcoats, and short hair
- **Women:**  Straight, loose dresses (moving towards the “flapper” style), bobbed hair, cloche hats

# Artists and Period

## Period:

- 1912–1919 
- These are the main years for Synthetic Cubism

## Key Artists:

### Pablo Picasso

- **Picasso** was a Spanish artist whose prolific career spanned painting, sculpture, printmaking, ceramics, and stage design, making him one of the most influential figures in twentieth-century art[1][2][3]
- He co-founded Cubism with Georges Braque, pioneered collage, and consistently reinvented his style, with major periods including the Blue, Rose, African-influenced, Analytic and Synthetic Cubism, and later Surrealist and Neo-classical phases[1][3][5]
- Picasso’s works such as "Les Demoiselles d’Avignon" and "Guernica" revolutionised modern art, and his relentless innovation shaped the direction of Western art for decades[1][3][6]

### Georges Braque

- ** Braque** was a French painter and collagist who, alongside Picasso, developed Cubism, focusing on the analysis and fragmentation of form and space
- His work is marked by muted colour palettes, subtle textures, and a deep exploration of still life and landscape subjects
- Braque’s innovations in collage and papier collé were crucial to the evolution of modern art, and his partnership with Picasso was one of the most significant in art history

### Juan Gris

- **Gris** was a Spanish painter closely associated with Cubism, known for his precise, geometric compositions and clear, harmonious use of colour
- His approach to Cubism was more structured and classical than that of Picasso and Braque, often incorporating elements of Synthetic Cubism
- Gris’s refined style and theoretical writings contributed significantly to the intellectual foundation of the Cubist movement

### Fernand Léger

- **Léger** was a French painter whose work evolved from Cubism to a distinctive style characterised by bold colours, cylindrical forms, and themes of modernity and machinery
- He often depicted urban life, technology, and the human figure in a mechanised, almost abstract manner
- Léger’s art bridged Cubism and the emerging aesthetics of the Machine Age, influencing later movements such as Purism and Pop Art

### Jean Metzinger

- **Metzinger** was a French painter, theorist, and writer, instrumental in the development and promotion of Cubism
- He co-authored the first major treatise on Cubism, "Du Cubisme," and his works often feature fragmented forms and multiple perspectives
- Metzinger’s intellectual approach helped articulate the theoretical underpinnings of the Cubist movement

### Roger de La Fresnaye

- **La Fresnaye** was a French painter associated with Cubism, known for his vibrant colour palette and lyrical, structured compositions
- His works often depict contemporary life, portraits, and scenes of leisure, blending geometric abstraction with a sense of warmth and humanity
- La Fresnaye’s unique approach brought a poetic sensibility to Cubist art

### Alexander Archipenko

- **Archipenko** was a Ukrainian-born sculptor who brought Cubist principles into three dimensions, pioneering the use of negative space and geometric abstraction in sculpture
- His innovative works often combined traditional materials with new forms, challenging conventional ideas about volume and mass
- Archipenko’s experiments influenced the development of modern sculpture and the integration of Cubist aesthetics beyond painting

### Stuart Davis

- **Davis** was an American painter who adapted Cubist techniques to create vibrant, jazz-inspired compositions reflecting urban American life
- His work is characterised by bold colours, dynamic shapes, and a playful sense of rhythm and movement
- Davis’s synthesis of abstraction and popular culture made him a precursor to American modernism and Pop Art

### Ben Nicholson

- **Nicholson** was a British painter known for his abstract and geometric compositions, often featuring relief elements and a restrained colour palette
- He was influenced by Cubism and Constructivism, and his work played a key role in the development of modern art in Britain
- Nicholson’s art is noted for its clarity, balance, and harmonious integration of form and space

### Diego Rivera

- **Rivera** was a Mexican painter and muralist who incorporated elements of Cubism into his early work before turning to large-scale, socially engaged murals
- His Cubist paintings are marked by bold structure and vivid colour, while his later murals depict Mexican history, society, and politics
- Rivera’s synthesis of European modernism and Mexican themes made him a leading figure in twentieth-century Latin American art

### František Kupka

- **Kupka** was a Czech painter and graphic artist who was an early pioneer of abstract art and Orphic Cubism
- His work explores the relationship between colour, movement, and music, often resulting in dynamic, non-representational compositions
- Kupka’s theoretical writings and innovative paintings contributed to the evolution of abstraction within the Cubist context

# Three Short Points for Students

- Synthetic Cubism introduced collage, mixing paint with real objects like newspaper and fabric to create playful, multi-layered artworks
- The movement used simple shapes and bright colours, making pictures that were easier to recognise than earlier Cubist art
- Artists blurred the line between art and everyday life, challenging traditional ideas and making viewers think about what art could be

# Glossary for Students:

- **Collage:** Artwork made by sticking different materials (like paper or fabric) onto a surface
- **Figurative:** Art that shows real things, especially people or objects
- **Perspective:** The technique of showing depth or distance in a picture
- **Synthesis:** Combining different things to make something new.
